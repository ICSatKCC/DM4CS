<div class="para">Now suppose that you have NFAs that accept the languages generated by the regular expressions <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_2\text{.}\)</span> Building a machine that accepts <span class="process-math">\(L(r_1
\REOR
r_2)\)</span> is fairly straightforward: take an NFA <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> that accepts <span class="process-math">\(L(r_1)\)</span> and an NFA <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> that accepts <span class="process-math">\(L(r_2)\text{.}\)</span> Introduce a new state <span class="process-math">\(q_{new}\text{,}\)</span> connect it to the start states of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> via <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-transitions, and designate it as the start state of the new machine. No other transitions are added. The final states of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> together with the final states of <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> are designated as the final states of the new machine. It should be fairly clear that this new machine accepts exactly those strings accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> together with those strings accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M_2\text{:}\)</span> any string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> that was accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> will be accepted by the new NFA by starting with an <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transition to the old start state of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> and then following the accepting path through <span class="process-math">\(M_1\text{;}\)</span> similarly, any string accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> will be accepted by the new machine; these are the only strings that will be accepted by the new machine, as on any input <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> all the new machine can do is make an <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-move to <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span>’s (or <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span>’s) start state, and from there <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> will only be accepted by the new machine if it is accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M_1\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span>). Thus, the new machine accepts <span class="process-math">\(L(M_1) \cup L(M_2)\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(L(r_1) \cup
L(r_2)\text{,}\)</span> which is exactly the definition of <span class="process-math">\(L(r_1 \REOR r_2)\text{.}\)</span> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/fsa15.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Diagram of an NFA that accepts \(L(r_1 \REOR r_2)\text{.}\)"></div>
