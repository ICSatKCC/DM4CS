<div class="para">I have given a very formal and detailed proof of this theorem, to show how it can be done and to show how induction plays a role in many proofs about grammars. However, a more informal proof of the theorem would probably be acceptable and might even be more convincing. To show that <span class="process-math">\(L\SUB L(G)\text{,}\)</span> we could just note that the derivation <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS aSb\YIELDS
a^2Sb^2\YIELDS\)</span><span class="process-math">\(\cdots\)</span><span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS a^nSb^n\YIELDS a^nb^n\)</span> demonstrates that <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\in L\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, it is clear that every derivation for this grammar must be of this form, so every string in <span class="process-math">\(L(G)\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\text{.}\)</span>
