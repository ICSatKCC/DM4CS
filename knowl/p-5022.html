<div class="para">Suppose we are given an NFA <span class="process-math">\(N = (P, \Sigma, p_0, \partial, F_p)\text{,}\)</span> and we want to build a DFA <span class="process-math">\(D=(Q, \Sigma, q_0, \delta, F_q)\)</span> that accepts the same language. The idea is to make the states in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> correspond to {\em subsets} of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>’s states, and then to set up <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span>’s transition function <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> so that for any string <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0, w)\)</span> corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w)\text{;}\)</span> i.e.\ the {\bf single} state that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> gets you to in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> corresponds to the {\bf set} of states that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> could get you to in <span class="process-math">\(N\text{.}\)</span> If any of those states is accepting in <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> would be accepted by <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> and so the corresponding state in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> would be made accepting as well.</div>
