<div class="para">The set of atoms of the Boolean algebra <span class="process-math">\(\left[D_{30}; \lor , \land, \bar{\hspace{5
mm}}\right]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(M = \{2, 3, 5\}\text{.}\)</span> To see that <span class="process-math">\(a = 2\)</span> is an atom, let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be any nonzero element of <span class="process-math">\(D_{30}\)</span> and note that one of the two conditions <span class="process-math">\(x \land 2
= 2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x \land
2 = 1\)</span> holds. Of course, to apply the definition to this Boolean algebra, we must remind ourselves that in this case the 0-element is 1, the operation <span class="process-math">\(\land\)</span> is greatest common divisor, and the poset relation is “divides.” So if <span class="process-math">\(x = 10\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(10 \land 2 = 2\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(2 \mid 10\)</span>), so Condition 1 holds. If <span class="process-math">\(x = 15\text{,}\)</span> the first condition is not true. (Why?) However, Condition 2, <span class="process-math">\(15 \land 2 = 1\text{,}\)</span> is true. The reader is encouraged to show that 3 and 5 also satisfy the definition of an atom. Next, if we should compute the join (the least common multiple in this case) of all possible combinations of the atoms 2, 3, and 5 to generate all nonzero (non-1 in this case) elements of <span class="process-math">\(D_{30}\text{.}\)</span> For example, <span class="process-math">\(2 \lor 3 \lor 5 = 30\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2 \lor 5 = 10\text{.}\)</span> We state this concept formally in the following theorem, which we give without proof.</div>
