<div class="para">There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-2.html" title="Figure 13.1.11">Figure 13.1.11</a> . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house. See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-house-13-1.html" title="Exercise 13.1.5.11">Exercise 13.1.5.11</a>. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between them.</div>
