<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">Commentary: The usual and first approach would be to assume <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\cap C = \emptyset\)</span> is true and to attempt to prove <span class="process-math">\(A\cap C = \emptyset\)</span> is true. To do this you would need to show that nothing is contained in the set <span class="process-math">\(A \cap  C\text{.}\)</span> Think about how you would show that something doesn’t exist. It is very difficult to do directly.</div> <div class="para">The Indirect Method is much easier: If we assume the conclusion is false and we obtain a contradiction ---  then the theorem must be true. This approach is on sound logical footing since it is exactly the same method of indirect proof that we discussed in <a href="section5_1-math-systems.html#sub-indirect-proof" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.1.3: Indirect Proof">Subsection 5.1.3</a>.</div> <div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\cap C = \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\cap C \neq  \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> To prove that this cannot occur, let <span class="process-math">\(x\in A \cap C\text{.}\)</span>

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
x \in A \cap C &amp; \Rightarrow x \in A \textrm{ and } x \in  C\\
&amp; \Rightarrow x \in B \textrm{ and } x \in  C\\
&amp; \Rightarrow x \in  B \cap C
