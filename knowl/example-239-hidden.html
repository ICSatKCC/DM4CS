<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Find a DFA with input alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma = \ab\)</span> that accepts the language <span class="process-math">\(L=
\{w \in\Sigma^* \ | \ n_a(w) \mbox{ and } n_b(w) \mbox{ are both even } \}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The characteristics that determine whether or not a string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> are the parity of <span class="process-math">\(n_a(w)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n_b(w)\text{.}\)</span> There are four possible combinations of ``values" for these characteristics: both numbers could be even, both could be odd, the first could be odd and the second even, or the first could be even and the second odd. So we build a machine with four states <span class="process-math">\(q_1, q_2, q_3,
q_4\)</span> corresponding to the four cases. We want to set up \delta so that the machine will be in state <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> exactly when it has consumed a string with an even number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s, in state <span class="process-math">\(q_2\)</span> exactly when it has consumed a string with an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s, and so on.</div> <div class="para">To do this, we first make the state <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> into our start state, because the DFA will be in the start state after consuming the empty string <span class="process-math">\(\varep\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span> has an even number (zero) of both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. Now we add transitions by reasoning about how the parity of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s is changed by additional input. For instance, if the machine is in <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> (meaning an even number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s have been seen) and a further <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is consumed, then we want the machine to move to state <span class="process-math">\(q_3\text{,}\)</span> since the machine has now consumed an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and still an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. So we add the transition <span class="process-math">\(\delta(q_1, a) = q_3\)</span> to the machine. Similarly, if the machine is in <span class="process-math">\(q_2\)</span> (meaning an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s have been seen) and a further <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is consumed, then we want the machine to move to state <span class="process-math">\(q_3\)</span> again, since the machine has still consumed an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s, and now an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. So we add the transition <span class="process-math">\(\delta(q_2, b) = q_3\)</span> to the machine. Similar reasoning produces a total of eight transitions, one for each state-input pair. Finally, we have to decide which states should be final states. The only state that corresponds to the desired criteria for the language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(q_1\text{,}\)</span> so we make <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> a final state. The complete machine is shown below. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/fsa5.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Transition diagram from description above"></div>
