<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(|V|=8\text{,}\)</span> then this theorem says that <span class="process-math">\(C_{cn}\)</span> can be no larger than twice the size of <span class="process-math">\(C_{opt}\text{;}\)</span> however, it doesn't say that the closest neighbor circuit will necessarily be that far from an optimal circuit. The quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\left\lceil
\log _2 (2n)\right\rceil
}{2}\)</span> is called an upper bound for the ratio <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\text{.}\)</span> It tells us only that things can't be any worse than the upper bound. Certainly, there are many graphs with eight vertices such that the optimal and closest neighbor circuits are the same. What is left unstated in this theorem is whether there are graphs for which the quantities are equal. If there are such graphs, we say that the upper bound is sharp.</div>
