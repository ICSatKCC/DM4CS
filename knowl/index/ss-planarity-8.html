<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para">A discussion of planarity is not complete without mentioning the famous Three Utilities Puzzle. The object of the puzzle is to supply three houses, A, B, and C, with the three utilities, gas, electric, and water. The constraint that makes this puzzle impossible to solve is that no utility lines may intersect. There is no planar embedding of the graph in <a href="s-planarity-and-colorings.html#fig-utilities-puzzle" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-utilities-puzzle.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 15.6.7">Figure 15.6.7</a>, which is commonly denoted <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\text{.}\)</span> This graph is one of two fundamental nonplanar graphs. The Kuratowski Reduction Theorem states that if a graph is nonplanar then it “contains” either a <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> or a <span class="process-math">\(K_5\text{.}\)</span> Containment is in the sense that if you start with a nonplanar graph you can always perform a sequence of edge deletions and contractions (shrinking an edge so that the two vertices connecting it coincide) to produce one of the two graphs.</div>
