<div class="para">Next, we establish the relation “is isomorphic to,” a form of equality on graphs. The graphs in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-isomorphic-graphs-15-1.html" title="Figure 15.1.27">Figure 15.1.27</a> obviously share some similarities, such as the number of vertices and the number of edges. It happens that they are even more similar than just that. If the letters <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> in the left graph are replaced with the numbers 1,3,4, and 2, respectively, and the vertices are moved around so that they have the same position as the graph on the right, you get the graph on the right.</div>
