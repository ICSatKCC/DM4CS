<div class="para">Note that the host can always open a door that has a goat behind it. After the host has opened No.3, we know that the car is either behind No.1 or No.2, and it seems that both these doors have the same probability (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(50\%\)</span>) of having the car behind them. We will prove below, however, that this is not true: It is indeed to our advantage to switch our choice.</div>
