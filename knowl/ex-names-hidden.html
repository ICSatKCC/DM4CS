<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Assume that a room contains four students with the first names John, James, and Mary. Prove that two students have the same first name. We can visualize a mapping from the set of students to the set of first names; each student has a first name. The pigeonhole principle applies with <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> and we can conclude that at least two of the students have the same first name.</div></article></body>
