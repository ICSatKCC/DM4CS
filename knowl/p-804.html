<div class="para">We all have some intuitive understanding of the notions of “chance” and “probability”. When buying a lottery ticket, we know that there is a chance of winning the jackpot, but we also know that this chance is very small. Before leaving home in the morning, we check the weather forecast and see that, with probability <span class="process-math">\(80\%\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> inches of rain in Honolulu. In this chapter, we will give a formal definition of this notion of “probability”.</div>
