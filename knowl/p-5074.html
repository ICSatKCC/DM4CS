<div class="para">The fact that our models for mechanical language-recognition accept exactly the same languages as those generated by our mechanical language-generation system would seem to be a very positive indication that in ``regular" we have in fact managed to isolate whatever characteristic it is that makes a language ``mechanical". Unfortunately, there are languages that we intuitively think of as being mechanically-recognizable (and which we could write C++ programs to recognize) that are not in fact regular.</div>
