<div class="para">When regular expressions are used in search-and-replace operations, a regular expression is used for the search pattern.  A search is made in a (typically long) string for a substring that matches the pattern, and then the substring is replaced by a specified replacement pattern.  The replacement pattern is not used for matching and is not a regular expression.  However, it can be more than just a simple string.  It’s possible to include parts of the substring that is being replaced in the replacement string. The notations <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\0,\1, ..., \9</code> are used for this purpose.  The first of these, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\0</code>, stands for the entire substring that is being replaced. The others are only available when parentheses are used in the search pattern.  The notation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\1</code> stands for ``the part of the substring that matched the part of the search pattern beginning with the first <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(</code> in the pattern and ending with the matching <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>.’’  Similarly, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\2</code> represents whatever matched the part of the search pattern between the second pair of parentheses, and so on.</div>
