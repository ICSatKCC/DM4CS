When is <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> one to one? When is it onto? Under normal circumstances, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span>  would always be injective since no two different students would be in the same seat.  In order for <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> to be surjective, we need all seats to be used, so <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span>  is a surjection if the classroom is filled to capacity.</div></article></body>
