<div class="para">LR(1) parsing uses a <dfn class="terminology">shift/reduce</dfn> algorithm.  Imagine a cursor or current position that moves through the string that is being parsed.  We can visualize the cursor as a vertical bar, so for the string <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z\text{,}\)</span> we start with the configuration <span class="process-math">\(|(x+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  A <em class="emphasis">shift</em> operation simply moves the cursor one symbol to the right.  For example, a shift operation would convert <span class="process-math">\(|(x+y)*z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((|x+y)*z\text{,}\)</span> and a second shift operation would convert that to <span class="process-math">\((x|+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  In a reduce operation, one or more symbols immediately to the left of the cursor are recognized as the right-hand side of one of the production rules in the grammar.  These symbols are removed and replaced by the left-hand side of the production rule. For example, in the configuration <span class="process-math">\((x|+y)*z\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to the left of the cursor is the right-hand side of the production rule <span class="process-math">\(F\PRODUCES x\text{,}\)</span> so we can apply a reduce operation and replace the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> giving <span class="process-math">\((F|+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  This first reduce operation corresponds to the last step in the right derivation of the string, <span class="process-math">\((F+y)*z\YIELDS (x+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  Now the <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> can be recognized as the right-hand side of the production rule <span class="process-math">\(T\PRODUCES F\text{,}\)</span> so we can replace the <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> giving <span class="process-math">\((T|+y)*z\text{.}\)</span> This corresponds to the next-to-last step in the right derivation, <span class="process-math">\((T+y)*z\YIELDS (F+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>
