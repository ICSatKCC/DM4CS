<div class="para">This homogeneous second-order linear relation with variable coefficients, together with the initial conditions <span class="process-math">\(D(1) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D(2) = 1\text{,}\)</span> completely defines <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> Instead of deriving a solution of this relation by analytical methods, we will give an empirical derivation of an approximation of <span class="process-math">\(D(n)\text{.}\)</span> Since the derangements of <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2
. . . , n\}\)</span> are drawn from a pool of <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> permutations, we will see what percentage of these permutations are derangements by listing the values of <span class="process-math">\(n!\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(D(n)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{D(n)}{n!}\text{.}\)</span> The results we observe will indicate that as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> grows, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{D(n)}{n!}\)</span> hardly changes at all. If this quotient is computed to eight decimal places, for <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 12\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(D(n)/n!
= 0.36787944\text{.}\)</span> The reciprocal of this number, which <span class="process-math">\(D(n)/n!\)</span> seems to be tending toward, is, to eight places, 2.7182818. This number appears in so many places in mathematics that it has its own name, <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> An approximate solution of our recurrence relation on <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is then <span class="process-math">\(D(n)\approx \frac{n!}{e}\text{.}\)</span>
