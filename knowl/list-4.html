<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Assume that we have a graph with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices that can be indexed by the integers <span class="process-math">\(1, 2, \dots, n\text{.}\)</span> Here are three different data structures that can be employed to represent graphs.</div></div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Adjacency Matrix: As we saw in Chapter 6, the information about edges in a graph can be summarized with an adjacency matrix, <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(G_{ij}=1\)</span> if and only if vertex <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is connected to vertex <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> in the graph. Note that this is the same as the adjacency matrix for a relation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Edge Dictionary: For each vertex in our graph, we maintain a list of edges that initiate at that vertex. If <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> represents the graphâ€™s edge information, then we denote by <span class="process-math">\(G_i\)</span> the list of vertices that are terminal vertices of edges initiating at vertex <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> The exact syntax that would be used can vary. We will use Sage/Python syntax in our examples.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Edge List: Note that in creating either of the first two data structures, we would presume that a list of edges for the graph exists. A simple way to represent the edges is to maintain this list of ordered pairs, or two element sets, depending on whether the graph is intended to be directed or undirected. We will not work with this data structure here, other than in the first example.</div></li>
