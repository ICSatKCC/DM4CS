<div class="para">As a simple example, consider a grammar that has three production rules:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{gather*}
S\PRODUCES aS\\
S\PRODUCES bS \\
S\PRODUCES b 
\end{gather*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this example, <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is the only non-terminal symbol, and the terminal symbols are <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Starting from the string <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> we can apply any of the three rules of the grammar to produce either <span class="process-math">\(aS\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(bS\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Since the string <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> contains no non-terminals, we see that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is one of the strings in the language generated by this grammar. The strings <span class="process-math">\(aS\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(bS\)</span> are not in that language, since they contain the non-terminal symbol <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> but we can continue to apply production rules to these strings. From <span class="process-math">\(aS\text{,}\)</span> for example, we can obtain <span class="process-math">\(aaS\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(abS\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(ab\text{.}\)</span> From <span class="process-math">\(abS\text{,}\)</span> we go on to obtain <span class="process-math">\(abaS\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(abbS\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(abb\text{.}\)</span> The strings <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(abb\)</span> are in the language generated by the grammar. Itâ€™s not hard to see that any string of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\)</span> that ends with a <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> can be generated by this grammar, and that these are the only strings that can be generated. That is, the language generated by this grammar is the regular language specified by the regular expression <span class="process-math">\((a\REOR b)^{*}b\text{.}\)</span>
