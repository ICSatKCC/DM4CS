<div class="para">Finally, suppose that the first and last characters of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> are the same. Letâ€™s say that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> begins and ends with <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> (The case where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> begins and ends with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is handled in a similar way.) I claim that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> can be written in the form <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(G)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\in L(G)\)</span> and neither <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is the empty string. This will finish the induction, since we will then have by the induction hypothesis that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR y\text{,}\)</span> and we can derive <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> by first applying the rule <span class="process-math">\(S\PRODUCES SS\)</span> and then using the first <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> on the right-hand side to derive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the second to derive <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>
