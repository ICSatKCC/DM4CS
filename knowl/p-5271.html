<div class="para">We could look at other ways of specifying languages ``computationally.’’ One of the most natural is to imagine a Turing machine or computer program that runs forever and outputs an infinite list of strings over some alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{.}\)</span>  In the case of Turing machines, it’s convenient to think of a two-tape Turing machine that lists the strings on its second tape.  The strings in the list form a language over <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{.}\)</span>  A language that can be listed in this way is said to be  <dfn class="terminology">recursively enumerable</dfn>. Note that we make no assumption that the strings must be listed in any particular order, and we allow the same string to appear in the output any number of times.  Clearly, a recursively enumerable language is ``computable’’ in some sense.  Perhaps we have found a new type of computable language. But no---it turns out that we have just found another way of describing the Turing-acceptable languages.  The following theorem makes this fact official and adds one more way of describing the same class of languages: <aside class="aside aside-like"></aside>
