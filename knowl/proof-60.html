<div class="para">The number 5 is not a sharp upper bound for <span class="process-math">\(\chi(G)\)</span> because of the Four-Color Theorem.</div> <div class="para">This is a proof by Induction on the Number of Vertices in the Graph.</div> <div class="para">Basis: Clearly, a graph with one vertex has a chromatic number of 1.</div> <div class="para">Induction: Assume that all planar graphs with <span class="process-math">\(n - 1\)</span> vertices have a chromatic number of 5 or less. Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be a planar graph. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-degree-5.html" title="Theorem 13.6.12: A Vertex of Degree Five">Theorem 13.6.12</a>, there exists a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\deg v \leq 5\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(G - v\)</span> be the planar graph obtained by deleting <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and all edges that connect <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> to other vertices in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> By the induction hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(G - v\)</span> has a 5-coloring. Assume that the colors used are red, white, blue, green, and yellow.</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\deg v &lt; 5\text{,}\)</span> then we can produce a 5-coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> by selecting a color that is not used in coloring the vertices that are connected to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> with an edge in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\deg v = 5\text{,}\)</span> then we can use the same approach if the five vertices that are adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> are not all colored differently.

Assume that they are colored red, white blue, yellow, and green, respectively, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-five-coloring-proof.html" title="Figure 13.6.17">Figure 13.6.17</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 64%; margin-left: 18%; margin-right: 18%;"><img src="external/images/fig-five-coloring-proof.png" class="contained" alt="Figure used in the proof of the five color theorem"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">13.6.17<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G-v\text{,}\)</span> suppose we try to construct a path <span class="process-math">\(v_3\)</span> that passes through only red and blue vertices. This can either be accomplished or it can't be accomplished. If it can't be done, consider all paths that start at <span class="process-math">\(v_1\text{,}\)</span> and go through only red and blue vertices. If we exchange the colors of the vertices in these paths, including <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> we still have a 5-coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G - v\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> is now blue, we can color the central vertex, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> red.</div> <div class="para">Finally, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(v_3\)</span> using only red and blue vertices.

We can then repeat the same process as in the previous paragraph with <span class="process-math">\(v_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_4\text{,}\)</span> which will allow us to color v white.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-planarity-and-colorings.html#proof-60" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
