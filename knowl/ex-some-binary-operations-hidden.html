<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">Union <span class="process-math">\(\cup\)</span> and intersection <span class="process-math">\(\cap\)</span> are both binary operations on the power set of any universe. Addition <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and multiplication <span class="process-math">\(\times\)</span> are binary operators on the natural numbers.
