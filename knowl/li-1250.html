<div class="para">How to compute the terms of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is not so clear. Suppose that you wanted to know <span class="process-math">\(B(100)\text{.}\)</span> One approach would be to apply the definition recursively:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
B(100) = B(99) + 3 = (B(98) + 3) + 3 =\cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The recursion equation for <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> would be applied 100 times and 100 additions would then follow. To compute <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\)</span> by this method, <span class="process-math">\(2k\)</span> operations are needed. An iterative computation of <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\)</span> is an improvement: <span class="process-math">\(B(1) =B(0) +3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\
\\
B(2) =B(1)+3= 5 + 3 = 8\\
\\
\text{etc}.\)</span> Only <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> additions are needed. This still isnâ€™t a good situation. As <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> gets large, we take more and more time to compute <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\text{.}\)</span>  The formula <span class="process-math">\(B(k)=B(k-1)+3\)</span> is called a recurrence relation on <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The process of finding a closed form expression for <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\text{,}\)</span> one that requires no more than some fixed number of operations, is called solving the recurrence relation.</div>
