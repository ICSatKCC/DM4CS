<div class="para">A committee usually starts as an unstructured set of people selected from a larger membership. Therefore, a committee can be thought of as a combination. If a club of 25 members has a five-member social committee, there are <span class="process-math">\(\binom{25}{5}=\frac{25\cdot 24\cdot 23\cdot 22\cdot 21}{5!} = 53130\)</span> different possible social committees. If any structure or restriction is placed on the way the social committee is to be selected, the number of possible committees will probably change. For example, if the club has a rule that the treasurer must be on the social committee, then the number of possibilities is reduced to <span class="process-math">\(\binom{24}{4}=\frac{24 23 22 21}{4!} = 10626\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If we further require that a chairperson other than the treasurer be selected for the social committee, we have  <span class="process-math">\(\binom{24}{4} \cdot 4 = 42504\)</span> different possible social committees. The choice of the four non-treasurers accounts for the factor <span class="process-math">\(\binom{24}{4}\)</span> while the need to choose a chairperson accounts for the 4.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section2_4-combinations-and-the-binomial-theorem.html#committee-of-five" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
