<div class="para">We do this by showing that there is no threshold value for the language. Let <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> be an arbitrary candidate for threshold value. We want to show that it is not in fact a threshold value, so we want to find a string in the language whose length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and which can’t be broken down in the way described by the Pumping Lemma. What string should we try to prove unbreakable? We can’t pick strings like <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> because we’re working with an arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> i.e. making no assumptions about <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>’s value; picking <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> is implicitly assuming that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is no bigger than 200 --- for larger values of <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> would not be ``a string whose length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>". Whatever string we pick, we <em class="emphasis">have</em> to be sure that its length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> no matter what number <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is. So we pick, for instance, <span class="process-math">\(w = a^Nb^N\text{.}\)</span> This string is in the language, and its length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> no matter what number <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is. If we can show that this string can’t be broken down as described by the Pumping Lemma, then we’ll have shown that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> doesn’t work as a threshold value, and since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> was an arbitrary number, we will have shown that there is no threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is not regular. So let’s show that <span class="process-math">\(w =
a^Nb^N\)</span> can’t be broken down appropriately.</div> <div class="para">We need to show that you can’t write <span class="process-math">\(w = a^Nb^N\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(w=xyz\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> together contain at most <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> symbols, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> isn’t empty, and all the strings <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyyz\text{,}\)</span> etc.\ are still in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> i.e. of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\)</span> for some number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The best way to do this is to show that any choice for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> being whatever precedes it and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> being whatever follows) that satisfies the first two requirements fails to satisfy the third. So what are our possible choices for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{?}\)</span> Well, since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> together can contain at most <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> symbols, and <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> starts with <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s, both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must be made up entirely of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s; since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can’t be empty, it must contain at least one <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and (from (i)) no more than <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s. So the possible choices for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(y=a^k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(1
\leq k \leq N\text{.}\)</span> We want to show now that none of these choices will satisfy the third requirement by showing that for any value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> at least one of the strings <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyyz\text{,}\)</span> etc will not be in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> No matter what value we try for <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> we don’t have to look far for our rogue string: the string <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(a^Nb^N\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s deleted from it, looks like <span class="process-math">\(a^{N-k}b^N\text{,}\)</span> which is clearly not of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\text{.}\)</span> So the only <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>’s that satisfy (i) and (ii) don’t satisfy (iii); so <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> can’t be broken down as required; so <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is not a threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{;}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> was an arbitrary number, there is no threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{;}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is not regular.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-FSA-and-Regular-Languages.html#proof-58">in-context</a></span>
