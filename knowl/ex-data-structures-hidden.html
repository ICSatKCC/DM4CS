<div class="para">One of the keys to working with large amounts of information is to organize it in a consistent, logical way. A <dfn class="terminology">data structure</dfn> is a scheme for organizing data. A simple example of a data structure might be the information a college admissions department might keep on their applicants. Items might look something like this:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
ApplicantItem &amp; = (FirstName,MiddleInitial,LastName,StreetAddress,\\
&amp; City,State,Zip,HomePhone,CellPhone,EmailAddress,\\
&amp; HighSchool,Major,ApplicationPaid,MathSAT,VerbalSAT,\\
&amp; Recommendation1,Recommendation2,Recommendation3)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This structure is called a “flat file”.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A spreadsheet can be used to arrange data in this way. Although a “flat file” structure is often adequate, there are advantages to clustering some the information. For example the applicant information might be broken into four parts: name, contact information, high school, and application data:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
ApplicantItem &amp; = ((FirstName,MiddleInitial, LastName),\\
&amp;((StreetAddress,City,State,Zip),\\
&amp; (HomePhone,CellPhone),EmailAddress),\\
&amp;HighSchool,\\
&amp;(Major,ApplicationPaid,(MathSAT,VerbalSAT),\\
&amp;(Recommendation1,Recommendation2,Recommendation3))
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The first item in each ApplicantItem is a list <span class="process-math">\((FirstName, MiddleInitial,
LastName)\text{,}\)</span> with each item in that list being a single field of the original flat file. The third item is simply the single high school item from the flat file. The application data is a list and one of its items, is itself a list with the recommendation data for each recommendation the applicant has.</div>
</div> <div class="para">The organization of this data can be visualized with a rooted tree such as the one in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-applicant-tree.html" title="Figure 16.3.7">Figure 16.3.7</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/fig-applicant-tree.png" class="contained" alt="Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">16.3.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">In general, you can represent a data item, <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> as a rooted tree with <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> as the root and a subtree for each field. Those fields that are more than just one item are roots of further subtrees, while individual items have no further children in the tree.</div></article></body>
