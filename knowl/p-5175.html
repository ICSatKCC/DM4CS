<div class="para">Before leaving this section, we should look at a few more general results. Since we know that most operations on regular languages produce languages that are also regular, we can ask whether a similar result holds for context-free languages. We will see later that the intersection of two context-free languages is not necessarily context-free. Also, the complement of a context-free language is not necessarily context-free. However, some other operations on context-free languages do produce context-free languages.</div>
