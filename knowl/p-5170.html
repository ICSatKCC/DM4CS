<div class="para">Suppose that the first and last characters of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> are different. Then <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is either of the form <span class="process-math">\(axb\)</span> or of the form <span class="process-math">\(bxa\text{,}\)</span> for some string <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Let’s assume that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(axb\text{.}\)</span> (The case where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(bxa\)</span> is handled in a similar way.) Since <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> has the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has one fewer <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and one fewer <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must also have the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span> That is <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(|x|=|w|-2 \lt k\text{,}\)</span> so by the induction hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(G)\text{.}\)</span> So we have <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-context-free-grammar.html" title="Theorem 17.5.2">Theorem 17.5.2</a>, we get then <span class="process-math">\(aSb\;\YIELDSTAR
axb\text{.}\)</span> Combining this with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS aSb\text{,}\)</span> we get that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR
axb\text{,}\)</span> that is, <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR w\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(w\in L(G)\text{.}\)</span>
