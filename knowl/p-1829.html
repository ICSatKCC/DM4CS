<div class="para">Our final example will be an outline of the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational (not an element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>). This is an example of the theorem that does not appear to be in the standard <span class="process-math">\(P \Rightarrow  C\)</span> form. One way to rephrase the theorem is: If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a  rational number, then <span class="process-math">\(x^2\neq 2\text{.}\)</span> A direct proof of this theorem would require that we verify that the square of every rational number is not equal to 2. There is no convenient way of doing this, so we must turn to the indirect method of proof. In such a proof, we assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a  rational number and that <span class="process-math">\(x^2=2\text{.}\)</span> This will lead to a contradiction. In order to reach this contradiction, we need to use the following facts:</div>
