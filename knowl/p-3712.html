<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-reverse-solutions-rr.html" title="Table 13.1.6: Recurrence relations obtained from given sequences">TableÂ 13.1.6</a> summarizes our results together with a few other examples that we will let the reader derive. Based on these results, we might conjecture that any closed form expression for a sequence that combines exponential expressions and polynomial expressions will be solutions of finite order linear relations. Not only is this true, but the converse is true: a finite order linear relation defines a closed form expression that is similar to the ones that were just examined. The only additional information that is needed is a set of initial conditions.</div>
