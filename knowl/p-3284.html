<div class="para">The next level of abstraction is the axiomatic level. At this level, the elements of the domain are not specified, but certain axioms are stated about the number of operations and their properties. The system that we called <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is an axiomatic system. Some combinations of axioms are so common that a name is given to any algebraic system to which they apply. Any system with the properties of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is called a monoid. The study of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> would be called monoid theory. The assumptions that we made about <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> associativity and the existence of an identity, are called the monoid axioms. One of your few brushes with the axiomatic level may have been in your elementary algebra course. Many algebra texts identify the properties of the real numbers with addition and multiplication as the field axioms. The real numbers share these axioms with other concrete systems, all of which are called fields.</div>
