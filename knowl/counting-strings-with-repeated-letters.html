<div class="para">Suppose we wish to count the number of ways we can rearrange the letters in the word "PROCESSES". For this kind of counting problem we cannot apply the Permutation Formula because two letters, "S" and "E", are repeated. We also cannot use the Rule of Products because the repetition is limited, we only have three "S"s, two "E"s, and one each of "P", "R", "O" and "C" to choose.</div> <div class="para">We have nine positions to fill. We can first choose three of those positions for the "S"s: <span class="process-math">\(\binom{9}{3}\)</span> (note we use the binomial formula because the "S"s are identical, the order of the "S"s doesn't matter). Then we will have six positions left to fill. We can choose two of those for the "E"s: <span class="process-math">\(\binom{6}{2}\)</span> That leaves four positions for "P", three for "R", two for "O" and one for "C": <span class="process-math">\(\binom{4}{1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\binom{3}{1}\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(\binom{2}{1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\binom{1}{1}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We can then apply the product rule to determine how many ways there are to do all of those:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\binom{9}{3} \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{1} \binom{3}{1} \binom{2}{1} \binom{1}{1} \amp
= \frac{9!}{6!3!} * \frac{6!}{4!2!} * \frac{4!}{3!1!} * \frac{3!}{2!1!} * \frac{2!}{1!1!} * \frac{1!}{0!1!} \\
\amp \text{Most cancel or are 1}\\
\amp = \frac{9!}{3!2!1!1!1!}\\
\amp = 30240
