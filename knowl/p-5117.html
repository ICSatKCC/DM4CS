<div class="para">Though the Pumping Lemma says something about regular languages, it is not used to prove that languages are regular. It says ``<em class="emphasis">if</em> a language is regular, then certain things happen", not ``if certain things happen, <em class="emphasis">then</em> you can conclude that the language is regular." However, the Pumping Lemma is useful for proving that languages are not regular, since the contrapositive of ``if a language is regular then certain things happen" is ``if certain things donâ€™t happen then you can conclude that the language is not regular." So what are the ``certain things"? Basically, the P.L. says that if a language is regular, there is some ``threshold" length for strings, and every string that goes over that threshold can be broken down in a certain way. Therefore, if we can show that ``there is some threshold length for strings such that every string that goes over that threshold can be broken down in a certain way" is a false assertion about a language, we can conclude that the language is not regular. How do you show that there is no threshold length? Saying a number is a threshold length for a language means that every string in the language that is at least that long can be broken down in the ways described. So to show that a number is not a threshold value, we have to show that there is some string in the language that is at least that long that cannot be broken down in the appropriate way.</div>
