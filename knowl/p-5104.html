<div class="para">The fact that languages like <span class="process-math">\(\{a^nb^n\ | \ n \geq 0\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{a^p \ |\ p \mbox{
is prime}\}\)</span> are not regular is a severe blow to any idea that regular expressions or finite-state automata capture the language-generation or language-recognition capabilities of a computer: They are both languages that we could easily write programs to recognize.  It is not clear how the expressive power of regular expressions could be increased, nor how one might modify the FSA model to obtain a more powerful one.  However, in the next chapter you will be introduced to the concept of a {\em grammar} as a tool for generating languages. The simplest grammars still only produce regular languages, but you will see that more complicated grammars have the power to generate languages far beyond the realm of the regular.</div>
