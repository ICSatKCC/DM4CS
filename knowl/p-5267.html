<div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is run with input <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> it is possible that it will just keep running forever without halting.  In that case, it doesn’t make sense to ask about the output of the computation.  Suppose however that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> does halt on input <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  Suppose, furthermore, that when <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> halts, its tape is blank except for a string <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> of non-blank symbols, and that the machine is located on the first character of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  In this case, we will say that ``<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> halts with output <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>’’ In addition, if <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> halts with an entirely blank tape, we say that ``<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> halts with output <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\text{.}\)</span>’’ Note that when we run <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> with input <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> one of three things can happen: (1)~<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>~might halt with some string as output; (1)~<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>~might fail to halt; or (3)~<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>~might halt in some configuration that doesn’t count as outputting any string.</div>
