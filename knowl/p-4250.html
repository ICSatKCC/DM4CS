<div class="para">This section is devoted to a question that, when posed in relation to the graphs that we have examined, seems trivial. That question is: Given two vertices, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> of a graph, is there a path from <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{?}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(s = t\text{,}\)</span> this question is interpreted as asking whether there is a circuit of positive length starting at <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> Of course, for the graphs we have seen up to now, this question can be answered after a brief examination.</div>
