<div class="para">Suppose that the information about edges in a graph is stored in an adjacency matrix, <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> The relation, <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> defines is <span class="process-math">\(v r w\)</span> if there is an edge connecting <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Recall that the composition of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> with itself, <span class="process-math">\(r^2\text{,}\)</span> is defined by <span class="process-math">\(v r^2 w\)</span> if there exists a vertex <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(v r y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y r w\text{;}\)</span> that is, <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> by a path of length 2. We could prove by induction that the relation <span class="process-math">\(r^k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(k\geq 1\text{,}\)</span> is defined by <span class="process-math">\(v r^k w\)</span> if and only if there is a path of length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Since the transitive closure, <span class="process-math">\(r^+\text{,}\)</span> is the union of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r^2\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(,r^3,\ldots\text{,}\)</span> we can answer our connectivity question by determining the transitive closure of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> which can be done most easily by keeping our relation in matrix form. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-13-3-1.html" title="Theorem 13.3.2: Maximal Path Theorem">TheoremÂ 13.3.2</a> is significant in our calculations because it tells us that we need only go as far as <span class="process-math">\(G^n\)</span> to determine the matrix of the transitive closure.</div>
