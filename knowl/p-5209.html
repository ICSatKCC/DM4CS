<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> be the set of all strings of length zero or more that can be made using each of the elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> zero or more times. By the generalized rule of products, there are <span class="process-math">\(5^n\)</span> such strings that have length <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 0\text{,}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(X_n\)</span> is the set of strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with the property that all of the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s precede all of the <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>’s, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span>’s, and <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span>’s. Thus <span class="process-math">\(aaabde \in X_6\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(abcabc \notin X_6\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(R(n) =\lvert X_n \rvert\text{.}\)</span> A closed form expression for <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> can be obtained by recognizing <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> as the convolution of two sequences. To illustrate our point, we will consider the calculation of <span class="process-math">\(R(6)\text{.}\)</span>
