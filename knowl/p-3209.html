<li><div class="para">We stress that the image of each ordered pair must be in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> This requirement disqualifies subtraction on the natural numbers from consideration as a binary operation, since <span class="process-math">\(1 - 2\)</span> is not a natural number. Subtraction is a binary operation on the integers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">On Notation. Despite the fact that a binary operation is a function, symbols, not letters, are used to name them. We will use a bullet point symbol, <span class="process-math">\(\bullet\)</span> to represent an arbitrary binary operation. We will also use a diamond, <span class="process-math">\(\diamond\text{,}\)</span> when a second symbol is needed. Another commonly used symbol is an asterisk, <span class="process-math">\(*\text{,}\)</span> but that tends to be confusing due to its use as the multiplication operator in many programming languages so we will avoid it.</div></li>
