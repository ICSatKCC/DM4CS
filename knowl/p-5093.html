<div class="para">How does one prove that a language is not regular? We could try proving that there is no DFA or NFA that accepts it, or no regular expression that generates it, but this kind of argument is generally rather difficult to make. It is hard to rule out all possible automata and all possible regular expressions. Instead, we will look at a property that all regular languages have; proving that a given language does not have this property then becomes a way of proving that that language is not regular.</div>
