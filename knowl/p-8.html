<em class="emphasis">Enumeration.</em> When the elements of a set are enumerated (or listed) it is traditional to enclose them in braces. For example, the set of binary digits is <span class="process-math">\(\{0, 1\}\)</span> and the set of decimal digits is <span class="process-math">\(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\text{.}\)</span> The choice of a name for these sets would be arbitrary; but it would be “logical” to call them <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> respectively. The choice of a set name is much like the choice of an identifier name in programming. Some large sets can be enumerated without actually listing all the elements. For example, the letters of the alphabet and the integers from 1 to 100 could be described as <span class="process-math">\(A
= \{a, b, c,\ldots , x, y, z\}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G = \{1, 2, \ldots , 99, 100\}\text{.}\)</span> The three consecutive “dots” are called an ellipsis. We use them when it is clear what elements are included but not listed. An ellipsis is used in two other situations. To enumerate the positive integers, we would write <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 3,\ldots \}\text{,}\)</span> indicating that the list goes on infinitely. If we want to list a more general set such as the integers between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is some undetermined positive integer, we might write <span class="process-math">\(\{1,\ldots ,n\}\text{.}\)</span>
