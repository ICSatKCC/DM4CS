<div class="para">Since each entry in Column 7 is the same as the corresponding entry in Column 8, we have shown that <span class="process-math">\(A\cap  (B \cup  C) = (A\cap B) \cup  (A \cap C)\)</span> for any sets <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The main advantage of this method is that it is mechanical. The main disadvantage is that it is reasonable to use only for a relatively small number of sets. If we are trying to prove a statement involving five sets, there are <span class="process-math">\(2^5 = 32\)</span> rows, which would test anyoneâ€™s patience doing the work by hand.</div>
