<div class="para">The binary number system differs from the decimal number system in that units are grouped by twos, fours, eights, etc. That is, the group sizes are powers of two instead of powers of ten. For example, twenty-three can be grouped into eleven groups of two with one left over. The eleven twos can be grouped into five groups of four with one group of two left over. Continuing along the same lines, we find that twenty-three can be described as one sixteen, zero eights, one four, one two, and one one, which is abbreviated <span class="process-math">\(10111_{\textrm{two}}\text{,}\)</span> or simply <span class="process-math">\(10111\)</span> if the context is clear.</div>
