<div class="para">Next, we compare Turing machines to a completely different method of specifying languages: grammars.  Suppose <span class="process-math">\(G=(V,\Sigma,P,S)\)</span> is a general grammar and that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the language generated by <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  Then there is a Turing machine, <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> that accepts the same language, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>  The alphabet for <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> will be <span class="process-math">\(V\cup\Sigma\cup\{\text{\$,#}\}\text{,}\)</span> where $ is a symbol that is not in <span class="process-math">\(V\cup\Sigma\text{.}\)</span> (We also assume that # is not in <span class="process-math">\(V\cup\Sigma\text{.}\)</span>) Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is started with input <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(w\in\Sigma^*\text{.}\)</span> We have to design <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> so that it will halt if and only if <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\text{.}\)</span> The idea is to have <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> find each string that can be derived from the start symbol <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>  The strings will be written to <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>’s tape and separated by $’s.  <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> can begin by writing the start symbol, <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> on its tape, separated from <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> by a $.  Then it repeats the following process indefinitely:  For each string on the tape and for each production rule, <span class="process-math">\(x\PRODUCES y\text{,}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> search the string for occurrences of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  When one is found, add a $ to the end of the tape and copy the string to the end of the tape, replacing the occurrence of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  The new string represents the results of applying the production rule <span class="process-math">\(x\PRODUCES y\)</span> to the string. Each time <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> produces a new string, it compares that string to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  If they are equal, then <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> halts.  If <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is in fact in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> then eventually <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> will produce the string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and will halt.  Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is not in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> will go on producing strings forever without ever finding <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> will never halt. This shows that, in fact, the language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is accepted by <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span>
