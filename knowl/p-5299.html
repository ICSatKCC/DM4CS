<div class="para">Note that a string over the alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\{h,q,L,R,\text{\#},0,1,a,',\text{\$}\}\)</span> might or might not encode a Turing machine.  However, it is a simple matter to check whether such a string is the code for a Turing machine. We can imagine the following process:  Generate all the strings over the alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\{h,q,L,R,\text{\#},0,1,a,',\text{\$}\}\text{.}\)</span>  Check each string to see whether it encodes a Turing machine.  If so, add the string to an output list. In this way, we can generate a list of all strings that encode standard Turing machines.  In effect, the standard Turing machines, or at least their symbolic representations, form a recursively enumerable set.  Let <span class="process-math">\(T_0\)</span> be the machine encoded by the first string in this list of standard Turing machines; let <span class="process-math">\(T_1\)</span> be the machine encoded by the second string; let <span class="process-math">\(T_2\)</span> be the machine encoded by the third string; and so on.  The list <span class="process-math">\(T_0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T_2\text{,}\)</span>~\dots, includes every standard Turing machine. Furthermore, given <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{,}\)</span> we can find the symbolic representation for <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> by generating strings in the list until we have <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> strings. Furthermore---and this is the essential point---we can use a Turing machine to do all these calculations.  In fact, there is a Turing machine that, when run with input <span class="process-math">\(a^n\text{,}\)</span> will halt with the string representation of <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> written on its tape as output. The Turing machine that does this is <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> the first of the two machines that we need.</div>
