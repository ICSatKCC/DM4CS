<div class="para">To see that the above equation holds, consider a string  <span class="process-math">\(w\in\Sigma^*\text{.}\)</span> Now,  <span class="process-math">\(w\in R_{i,j+1,k}\)</span> if and only if when  <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> starts in state  <span class="process-math">\(q_i\)</span> and reads  <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> it ends in state  <span class="process-math">\(q_k\text{,}\)</span> with all intermediate states in the computation in the set <span class="process-math">\(\{q_0,q_1,\dots,q_j\}\text{.}\)</span>  Consider such a computation.  There are two cases: Either  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> occurs as an intermediate state in the computation, or it does not. If it does <em class="emphasis">not</em> occur, then all the intermediate states are in the set <span class="process-math">\(\{q_0,q_1,\dots,q_{j-1}\}\text{,}\)</span> which means that in fact <span class="process-math">\(w\in R_{i,j,k}\text{.}\)</span> If  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> <em class="emphasis">does</em> occur as an intermediate state in the computation, then we can break the computation into phases, by dividing it at each point where  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> occurs as an intermediate state.  This breaks  <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> into a concatenation  <span class="process-math">\(w=xy_1y_2\cdots y_rz\text{.}\)</span> The string  <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is consumed in the first phase of the computation, during which  <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> goes from state  <span class="process-math">\(q_i\)</span> to the first occurrence of  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\text{;}\)</span> since the intermediate states in this computation are in the set <span class="process-math">\(\{q_0,q_1,\dots,q_{j-1}\}, x\in R_{i,j,j}\text{.}\)</span> The string  <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is consumed by the last phase of the computation, in which  <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> goes from the final occurrence of  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> to  <span class="process-math">\(q_k\text{,}\)</span> so that  <span class="process-math">\(z\in R_{j,j,k}\text{.}\)</span> And each string  <span class="process-math">\(y_t\)</span> is consumed in a phase of the computation in which  <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> goes from one occurrence of  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\)</span> to the next occurrence of  <span class="process-math">\(q_j\text{,}\)</span> so that  <span class="process-math">\(y_r\in R_{j,j,j}\text{.}\)</span> This means that  <span class="process-math">\(w=xy_1y_2\cdots y_rz\in R_{i,j,j}R_{j,j,j}^*R_{j,j,k}\text{.}\)</span>
