<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">To read this truth table, you must realize that any one line represents a case: one possible set of values for <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The numbers 0 and 1 are used to denote false and true, respectively. Sometimes you will see F and T instead. The use of 0 and 1  is consistent with the way that many programming languages treat logical, or <em class="emphasis">Boolean</em>, variables since a single bit, 0 or 1, can represent a truth value.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For each case, the symbol under <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> represents the truth value of <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> The same is true for <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> The symbol under <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> represents its truth value for that case. For example, the second row of the truth table represents the case in which <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is false, <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is true, and the resulting truth value for <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> is false. As in everyday speech, <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> is true only when both propositions are true.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Just as the letters <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are frequently used in algebra to represent numeric variables, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> seem to be the most commonly used symbols for logical variables. When we say that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a logical variable, we mean that any proposition can take the place of <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">One final comment: The order in which we list the cases in truth table rows is standardized in this book. It is important to be consistent with the ordering so that all possible combinations are represented.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">There will always be <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> rows in a truth table with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> propositions</div></li>
<li><div class="para">From top to bottom, the first column should have <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of the rows as 0s followed by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of the rows as 1s. The second column should have <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the rows 0s followed by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the rows 1s, then another <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> rows of 0s followed another <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> rows of 1s. The final column of simple propositions should have rows of alternating 0s and 1s.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the truth table involves two simple propositions, the numbers under the simple propositions can be interpreted as the two-digit binary integers in increasing order, 00, 01, 10, and 11, for 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</div></li>
