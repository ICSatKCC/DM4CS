<div class="para">For example, shown below is a transition diagram for a Turing machine that makes a copy of a string of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s.  To use this machine, you would write a string of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s on its tape, place the machine on the first character of the string, and start the machine in its start state,~<span class="process-math">\(q_0\text{.}\)</span>  When the machine halts, there will be two copies of the string on the tape, separated by a blank. The machine will be positioned on the first character of the leftmost copy of the string.  Note that this machine uses <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span>’s in addition to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s.  While it is copying the input string, it temporarily changes the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s that it has copied to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span>’s, respectively.  In this way it can keep track of which characters it has already copied.  After the string has been copied, the machine changes the <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span>’s back to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s before halting. <div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/turing3.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Transition diagram for Turing machine described above."></div>
