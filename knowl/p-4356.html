<div class="para">A common problem encountered in engineering is that of analog-to-digital (a-d) conversion, where the reading on a dial, for example, must be converted to a numerical value. In order for this conversion to be done reliably and quickly, one must solve an interesting problem in graph theory. Before this problem is posed, we will make the connection between a-d conversion and the graph problem using a simple example. Suppose a dial can be turned in any direction, and that the positions will be converted to one of the numbers zero through seven as depicted in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-a-d-dial.html" title="Figure 15.4.19">FigureÂ 15.4.19</a>. The angles from 0 to 360 are divided into eight equal parts, and each part is assigned a number starting with 0 and increasing clockwise. If the dial points in any of these sectors the conversion is to the number of that sector. If the dial is on the boundary, then we will be satisfied with the conversion to either of the numbers in the bordering sectors. This conversion can be thought of as giving an approximate angle of the dial, for if the dial is in sector <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> then the angle that the dial makes with east is approximately <span class="process-math">\({45k}^{\circ}\text{.}\)</span>
