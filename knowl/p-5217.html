<div class="para">After a few more shift and reduce operations, the configuration becomes <span class="process-math">\((E)|*z\text{,}\)</span> which we can reduce to <span class="process-math">\(T|*z\)</span> by applying the production rules <span class="process-math">\(F\PRODUCES (E)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\PRODUCES F\text{.}\)</span> Now, faced with <span class="process-math">\(T|*z\text{,}\)</span> we must once again decide between a shift operation and a reduce operation that applies the rule <span class="process-math">\(E\PRODUCES T\text{.}\)</span>  In this case, since the next character is a <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> rather than a <span class="process-math">\(+\text{,}\)</span> we apply the shift operation, giving <span class="process-math">\(T*|z\text{.}\)</span>  From there we get, in succession, <span class="process-math">\(T*z|\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T*F|\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T|/\text{,}\)</span> and finally <span class="process-math">\(E|\text{.}\)</span>  At this point, we have reduced the entire string <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z\)</span> to the start symbol of the grammar. The very last step, the reduction of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> corresponds to the first step of the right derivation, <span class="process-math">\(E\YIELDS T\text{.}\)</span>
