<div class="para">It’s easy to see that every string that can be generated using these rules is in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> since each rule introduces the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span> But we also need to check that every string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> can be generated by these rules. This can be done by induction on the length of <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> using the second form of the principle of mathematical induction. In the base case, <span class="process-math">\(|w|=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w=\EMPTYSTRING\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS\EMPTYSTRING\)</span> in one step. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(|w|=k\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\gt 0\text{,}\)</span> and suppose that we already know that for any <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|x|
\lt k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\text{.}\)</span> To finish the induction we must show, based on this induction hypothesis, that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR w\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Suppose that the first and last characters of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> are different. Then <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is either of the form <span class="process-math">\(axb\)</span> or of the form <span class="process-math">\(bxa\text{,}\)</span> for some string <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Let’s assume that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(axb\text{.}\)</span> (The case where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(bxa\)</span> is handled in a similar way.) Since <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> has the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has one fewer <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and one fewer <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must also have the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span> That is <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(|x|=|w|-2 \lt k\text{,}\)</span> so by the induction hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(G)\text{.}\)</span> So we have <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-context-free-grammar.html" title="Theorem 17.5.2">Theorem 17.5.2</a>, we get then <span class="process-math">\(aSb\;\YIELDSTAR
axb\text{.}\)</span> Combining this with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS aSb\text{,}\)</span> we get that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR
axb\text{,}\)</span> that is, <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR w\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(w\in L(G)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Finally, suppose that the first and last characters of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> are the same. Let’s say that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> begins and ends with <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> (The case where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> begins and ends with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is handled in a similar way.) I claim that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> can be written in the form <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(G)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\in L(G)\)</span> and neither <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is the empty string. This will finish the induction, since we will then have by the induction hypothesis that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR y\text{,}\)</span> and we can derive <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> by first applying the rule <span class="process-math">\(S\PRODUCES SS\)</span> and then using the first <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> on the right-hand side to derive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the second to derive <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">It only remains to figure out how to divide <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> into two strings <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> which are both in <span class="process-math">\(L(G)\text{.}\)</span> The technique that is used is one that is more generally useful. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(w=c_1c_2\cdots c_k\text{,}\)</span> where each <span class="process-math">\(c_i\)</span> is either <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Consider the sequence of integers <span class="process-math">\(r_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\dots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_k\)</span> where for each <span class="process-math">\(i = 1, 2, \dots, k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> is the number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(c_1c_2\cdots
c_i\)</span> minus the number of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(c_1c_2\cdots c_i\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(c_1=a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_1=1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_k=0\text{.}\)</span> And since <span class="process-math">\(c_k=a\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(r_{k-1}=
r_k-1 = -1\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore the difference between <span class="process-math">\(r_{i+1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> is either <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\dots,k-1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(r_1=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_{k-1}=-1\)</span> and the value of <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> goes up or down by 1 when <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> increases by 1, <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> must be zero for some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(k-1\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> cannot get from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> unless it passes through zero. Let <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> be a number between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(r_i=0\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(x=c_1c_2\cdots
c_i\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(y=c_{i+1}c_{i+2}\cdots c_k\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(xy=w\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(r_i=0\)</span> means that the string <span class="process-math">\(c_1c_2\cdots c_i\)</span> has the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(G)\text{.}\)</span> It follows automatically that <span class="process-math">\(y\in L(G)\)</span> also. Since <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is strictly between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(k-1\text{,}\)</span> neither <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is the empty string. This is all that we needed to show to finish the proof that <span class="process-math">\(L=L(G)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The basic idea of this proof is that if <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> contains the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{,}\)</span> then an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> at the beginning of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> must have a “matching” <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> somewhere in <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> This <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> matches the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in the sense that the corresponding <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> is zero, and the <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> marks the end of a string <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> which contains the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span> For example, in the string <span class="process-math">\(aababbabba\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> at the beginning of the string is matched by the third <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(aababb\)</span> is the shortest prefix of <span class="process-math">\(aababbabba\)</span> that has an equal number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span>
