<div class="introduction"><div class="para">What differentiates rooted trees from undirected trees is that a rooted tree contains a distinguished vertex, called the root. Consider the tree in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rooted-tree-16-3.html" title="Figure 16.3.1">Figure 16.3.1</a>. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has been designated the root of the tree. If we choose any other vertex in the tree, such as <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> we know that there is a unique path from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> The vertices on this path, <span class="process-math">\((A, D, K, M)\text{,}\)</span> are described in genealogical terms:</div></div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a child of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> (so is <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>’s parent.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>’s ancestors.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> are descendants of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="conclusion">
<div class="para">These genealogical relationships are often easier to visualize if the tree is rewritten so that children are positioned below their parents, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rooted-tree-16-3-redrawn.html" title="Figure 16.3.3">Figure 16.3.3</a>.</div> <div class="para">With this format, it is easy to see that each vertex in the tree can be thought of as the root of a tree that contains, in addition to itself, all of its descendants. For example, <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is the root of a tree that contains <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is the root of a tree that contains <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Finally, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> are roots of trees that contain only themselves. From this observation, we can give a formal definition of a rooted tree.</div>
