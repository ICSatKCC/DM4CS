<div class="para">Finally, we should clarify the relationship between context-free languages and regular languages. We have already seen that there are context-free languages which are not regular. On the other hand, it turns out that every regular language is context-free. That is, given any regular language, there is a context-free grammar that generates that language. This means that any syntax that can be expressed by a regular expression, by a DFA, or by an NFA could also be expressed by a context-free grammar. In fact, we only need a certain restricted type of context-free grammar to duplicate the power of regular expressions.</div>
