</div> <div class="para">Again, it is not quite so simple as making a two-state machine where the states correspond to ``have seen <span class="process-math">\(aaa\)</span>" and ``have not seen <span class="process-math">\(aaa\)</span>". Think dynamically: as you move through the input string, how do you arrive at the goal of having seen three consecutive <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s? You might have seen two consecutive <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and still need a third, or you might just have seen one <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and be looking for two more to come immediately, or you might just have seen a <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and be right back at the beginning as far as seeing 3 consecutive <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s goes. So once again there will be three states, with the ``last symbol was not an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’’ state being the start state. The complete automaton is shown below. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/fsa7.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Transition diagram that accepts the language \(L = \{w
