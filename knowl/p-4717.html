<div class="para">If a string <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can be obtained from a string <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by applying a sequence of zero or more production rules, we write <span class="process-math">\(x\YIELDS_G^* y\)</span> . In most cases, the “<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span>” in the notations <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS_G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS_G^*\)</span> will be omitted, assuming that the grammar in question is understood. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS\)</span> is a relation on the set <span class="process-math">\((V\cup\Sigma)^*\text{.}\)</span> The relation <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDSTAR\)</span> is the reflexive, transitive closure of that relation. (This explains the use of “<span class="process-math">\(*\)</span>”, which is usually used to denote the transitive, but not necessarily reflexive, closure of a relation. In this case, <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDSTAR\)</span> is reflexive as well as transitive since <span class="process-math">\(x\;\YIELDSTAR x\)</span> is true for any string <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>) For example, using the grammar that is defined by the above list of production rules, we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
aTB\amp \YIELDS aTTB\\
\amp \YIELDS aTAB \\
\amp \YIELDS aTAbB \\
\amp \YIELDS aTbBbB\\
\amp \YIELDS aTbbB
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">From this, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(aTB\;\YIELDSTAR
aTbbB\text{.}\)</span> The relation <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS\)</span> is read “yields” or “produces” while <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDSTAR\)</span> can be read “yields in zero or more steps” or “produces in zero or more steps.” The following theorem states some simple facts about the relations <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDSTAR\text{:}\)</span>
