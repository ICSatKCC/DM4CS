<div class="para">The binary search algorithm starts by comparing the item in the middle position of the sorted list to the target. If the middle item is the same as the target item, then the location is returned. If the target is larger than the middle item, the lower half of the list is disregarded, the middle becomes the new start of the list and the target is compared to the item halfway between the new start and the end. If the target is smaller than the middle item, the upper half of the list is disregarded, the middle becomes the new end of the list, and the target is compared to the item halfway between the beginning and the new end. This procedure continues until the target is found or the list is reduced to a single item and that doesn't match the target.</div>
