<div class="para">Recall that the set of positive integers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{P}\text{,}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 3, . . . \}\text{.}\)</span> Positive integers are naturally used to count things. There are many ways to count and many ways to record, or represent, the results of counting. For example, if we wanted to count five hundred twenty-three apples, we might group the apples by tens. There would be fifty-two groups of ten with three single apples left over. The fifty-two groups of ten could be put into five groups of ten tens (hundreds), with two tens left over. The five hundreds, two tens, and three units is recorded as 523. This system of counting is called the base ten positional system, or decimal system. It is quite natural for us to do grouping by tens, hundreds, thousands, <span class="process-math">\(\dots\)</span> since it is the method that all of us use in everyday life.</div>
