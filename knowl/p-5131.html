<div class="para">Both natural languages, such as English and the artificial languages used for programming have a structure known as grammar or syntax. In order to form legal sentences or programs, the parts of the language must be fit together according to certain rules. For natural languages, the rules are somewhat informal (although high-school English teachers might have us believe differently). For programming languages, the rules are absolute, and programs that violate the rules will be rejected by a compiler.</div>
