<div class="para">Suppose that you roll a die two times and add up the numbers on the top face for each roll. Since the faces on the die represent the integers 1 through 6, the sum must be between 2 and 12. How many ways can any one of these sums be obtained? Obviously, 2 can be obtained only one way, with two 1’s. There are two sequences that yield a sum of 3: 1-2 and 2-1. To obtain all of the frequencies with which the numbers 2 through 12 can be obtained, we set up the situation as follows. For <span class="process-math">\(j =
1, 2\text{;}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P_j\)</span> is the rolling of the die for the <span class="process-math">\(j^{\text{th}}\)</span> time. <span class="process-math">\(X_j
= \{1, 2, . . . , 6\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_j : X_j \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, 3,\ldots \}\)</span> is defined by <span class="process-math">\(Q_j(x) = x\text{.}\)</span> Since each number appears on a die exactly once, the frequency function is <span class="process-math">\(F_j(k)=1\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq k \leq 6\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_j(k) = 0\)</span> otherwise. The process of rolling the die two times is quantified by adding up the <span class="process-math">\({Q_j}'s\text{;}\)</span> that is, <span class="process-math">\(Q\left(a_1, a_2\right)
=Q_{1}\left(a_1\right)+Q_2\left(a_2\right)\)</span> . The generating function for the frequency function of rolling the die two times is then</div>

G(F; z) &amp; = G\left(F_1;z\right)G\left(F_2;z\right)\\

</div>
</div> <div class="para">Now, to get <span class="process-math">\(F(k)\text{,}\)</span> just read the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(z^k\text{.}\)</span> For example, the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(z^5\)</span> is 4, so there are four ways to roll a total of 5.</div> <div class="para">To apply this method, the crucial step is to decompose a large process in the proper way so that it fits into the general situation that we’ve described.</div></article></body>
