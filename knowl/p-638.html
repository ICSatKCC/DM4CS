<div class="para">How many ways can we select a set of three letters from  <span class="process-math">\(A = \{a, b, c, d\}\text{?}\)</span>  Note here that we are not concerned with the order of the three letters. By trial and error, abc, abd, acd, and bcd are the only listings possible. To repeat, we were looking for all three-element subsets of the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Order is not important in sets. The notation for choosing 3 elements from 4 is most commonly <span class="process-math">\(\binom{4}{3}\)</span> or occasionally <span class="process-math">\(C(4,3)\text{,}\)</span> either of which is read “4 choose 3” or the number of combinations for four objects taken three at a time.</div>
