<div class="para">This problem is just like giving 13 cookies to 5 kids. We need to say how many of the 13 units go to each of the 5 variables. In other words, we have 13 stars and 4 bars (the bars are like the “+” signs in the equation).</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> can be 0 or greater, we are in the standard case with no restrictions. So 13 stars and 4 bars can be arranged in <span class="process-math">\({17 \choose 4}\)</span> ways.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now each variable must be at least 1. So give one unit to each variable to satisfy that restriction. Now there are 8 stars left, and still 4 bars, so the number of solutions is <span class="process-math">\({12 \choose 4}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now each variable must be 2 or greater. So before any counting, give each variable 2 units. We now have 3 remaining stars and 4 bars, so there are <span class="process-math">\({7 \choose 4}\)</span> solutions.</div></li>
