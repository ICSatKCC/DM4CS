<div class="para">In the following SageMath cell, we plot <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^4 + 2^x\)</span> (red), this is an addition of two functions with the larger one being the exponential <span class="process-math">\(2^x\text{,}\)</span> so it should be <span class="process-math">\(\Theta(2^x)\text{.}\)</span> We show this by using <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 2^x\)</span> and plotting both <span class="process-math">\(c_1\,*\,g(x)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(c_1 = 20\)</span> to show <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = O(2^x)\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(c_2\,*\,g(x)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(c_2 = 1\)</span> to show <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \Omega(2^x)\)</span> with black dots. The resulting plot shows that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is bounded above by <span class="process-math">\(c_1 \,*\, g(x)\)</span> after <span class="process-math">\(x \approx 7\)</span> and it is always bounded below by <span class="process-math">\(c_2 \,*\, g(x)\)</span> . That is what we want to show for Big <span class="process-math">\(\Theta\text{.}\)</span>
