<div class="para">A direct product of algebraic systems is not always an algebraic system of the same type as its factors. This is due to the fact that certain axioms that are true for the factors may not be true for the set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples. This situation does not occur with groups however. You will find that whenever a new type of algebraic system is introduced, call it type <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> one of the first theorems that is usually proven, if possible, is that the direct product of two or more systems of type <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a system of type <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>
