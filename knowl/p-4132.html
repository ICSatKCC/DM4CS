<div class="para">The map of Euler Island in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-euler-island.html" title="Figure 13.6.13">FigureÂ 13.6.13</a> shows that there are seven towns on the island. Suppose that a cartographer must produce a colored map in which no two towns that share a boundary have the same color. To keep costs down, she wants to minimize the number of different colors that appear on the map. How many colors are sufficient? For Euler Island, the answer is three. Although it might not be obvious, this is a graph problem. We can represent the map with a graph, where the vertices are countries and an edge between two vertices indicates that the two corresponding countries share a boundary of positive length. This problem motivates a more general problem.</div>
