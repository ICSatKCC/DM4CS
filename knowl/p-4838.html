<div class="para">At this point, it would be useful to look at increasingly complex Turing machines, such as those with more tapes, which compute increasingly complex functions and languages. Although Turing machines are very simple devices, it turns out that they can perform very sophisticated computations.  In fact, any computation that can be carried out by a modern digital computer---even one with an unlimited amount of memory---can be carried out by a Turing machine.  Although it is not something that can be proved, it is widely believed that anything that can reasonably be called ``computation’’ can be done by a Turing machine.  This claim is known as the <dfn class="terminology">Church-Turing Thesis</dfn>.</div>
