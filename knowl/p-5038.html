<div class="para">First, a preliminary observation. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(w=xa\text{,}\)</span> i.e. <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is the string <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> followed by the single symbol <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> How are <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w)\)</span> related? Well, recall that <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,x)\)</span> is the set of all states that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> can reach when it starts in <span class="process-math">\(p_0\)</span> and consumes <span class="process-math">\(x\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,x) = \{p_1,
\ldots, p_n\}\)</span> for some states <span class="process-math">\(p_1, \ldots, p_n\text{.}\)</span> Now, <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is just <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with an additional <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> so where might <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> end up if it starts in <span class="process-math">\(p_0\)</span> and consumes <span class="process-math">\(w\text{?}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(p_n\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(xa\)</span> gets <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> to any state that can be reached from <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> with an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> (and maybe some <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transitions), and to any state that can be reached from <span class="process-math">\(p_2\)</span> with an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> (and maybe some <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transitions), etc. Thus, our relationship between <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w)\)</span> is that if <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,x)
= \{p_1, \ldots, p_n\}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w) = \partial^*(p_1,a)
\cup \ldots \cup \partial^*(p_n,a)\text{.}\)</span> With this observation in hand, letâ€™s proceed to our proof by induction.</div>
