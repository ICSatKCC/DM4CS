<div class="para">Intuitively, you could probably predict what the term “subgraph” means. A graph contained within a graph, right? But since a graph involves two sets, vertices and edges, does it involve a subset of both of these sets, or just one of them? The answer is it could be either. There are different types of subgraphs.
