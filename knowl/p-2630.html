<div class="para">The determination of <span class="process-math">\(C_k\)</span> is a standard kind of problem in combinatorics. One solution is by way of a recurrence relation. In fact, many problems in combinatorics are most easily solved by first searching for a recurrence relation and then solving it. The following observation will suggest the recurrence relation that we need to determine <span class="process-math">\(C_k\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(k \geq  2\text{,}\)</span> then every string of 0’s and 1’s with length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and no two consecutive 0’s is either <span class="process-math">\(1s_{k-1}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(01s_{k-2}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(s_{k-1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_{k-2}\)</span> are strings with no two consecutive 0’s of length <span class="process-math">\(k - 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k - 2\)</span> respectively. From this observation we can see that <span class="process-math">\(C_k= C_{k-2}+C_{k-1}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(k\geq 2\text{.}\)</span> The terms <span class="process-math">\(C_0=
1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_1 = 2\)</span> are easy to determine by enumeration. Now, by iteration, any <span class="process-math">\(C_k\)</span> can be easily determined. For example, <span class="process-math">\(C_5 = 21\)</span> can be computed with five additions. A closed form expression for <span class="process-math">\(C_k\)</span> would be an improvement. Note that the recurrence relation for <span class="process-math">\(C_k\)</span> is identical to the one for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-fibonacci-sequence.html" title="Example 8.4.7: The Fibonacci Sequence">The Fibonacci Sequence</a>. Only the basis is different.</div>
