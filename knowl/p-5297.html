<div class="para">To show that <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is not recursive, we need to show that there is <em class="emphasis">no</em> Turing machine that decides <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> be any Turing machine.  We must show that no matter what <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> does, it does not decide the language <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span>  We must do this without knowing anything more about <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> that the fact that is it a Turing machine.  To say that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> decides <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> would mean that for any <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{,}\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is run with input <span class="process-math">\(a^n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> will halt with output 1 if <span class="process-math">\(a^n\in K\)</span> and will halt with output 0 if <span class="process-math">\(a^n\not\in K\text{.}\)</span>  To show that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> does not decide <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> we need to show that there is some <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\)</span> such that when <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is run with input <span class="process-math">\(a^n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> either fails to halt or else halts but gives the wrong output.  Note in particular that we only need to find <em class="emphasis">one</em> <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> does not give the correct result. As we try to find <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we have nothing much to work with but <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> itself.</div>
