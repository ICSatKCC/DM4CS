<div class="para">A common operation when editing text is to search for a given string of characters, sometimes with the purpose of replacing it with another string.  Many ``search and replace''  facilities have the option of using regular expressions instead of simple strings of characters.  A regular expression describes a language, that is, a <em class="emphasis">set</em> of strings.  We can think of a regular expression as a <dfn class="terminology">pattern</dfn> that matches certain strings, namely all the strings in the language described by the regular expression. When a regular expression is used in a search operation, the goal is to find a string that matches the expression.  This type of <dfn class="terminology">pattern matching</dfn> is very useful.</div>
