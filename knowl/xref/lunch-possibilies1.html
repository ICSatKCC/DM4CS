<div class="para">A snack bar serves five different sandwiches and three different beverages. How many different lunches can a person order? One way of determining the number of possible lunches is by listing or enumerating all the possibilities. One systematic way of doing this is by means of a tree, as in the following figure.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/lunch.png" class="contained" alt="Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches."></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.1.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches.</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Every path that begins at the position labeled START and goes to the right can be interpreted as a choice of one of the five sandwiches followed by a choice of one of the three beverages. Note that considerable work is required to arrive at the number fifteen this way; but we also get more than just a number. The result is a complete list of all possible lunches. If we need to answer a question that starts with “How many . . . ,” enumeration would be done only as a last resort. In a later chapter we will examine more enumeration techniques.</div> <div class="para">An alternative method of solution for this example is to make the simple observation that there are five different choices for sandwiches and three different choices for beverages, so there are <span class="process-math">\(5 \cdot 3 = 15\)</span> different lunches that can be ordered.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section2_1-the-rule-of-products.html#lunch-possibilies1">in-context</a></span>
