<div class="para">We do have to think a bit carefully about what it means for an NFA to accept a string <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(q_0,w)\)</span> contains both accepting and non-accepting states, i.e.\ the machine could end in an accepting state after consuming <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> but it might also end in a non-accepting state. Should we consider the machine to accept <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> or should we require every state in <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(q_0,w)\)</span> to be accepting before we admit <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> to the ranks of the accepted? Think of the C++ compiler again: provided that an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">if</code> statement fits one of the legal syntax specifications, the compiler will accept it. So we take as the definition of acceptance by an NFA: A string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is accepted by an NFA provided that at least one of the states in <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(q_0,w)\)</span> is an accepting state. That is, if there is some sequence of steps of the machine that consumes <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and leaves the machine in an accepting state, then the machine accepts <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Formally:</div>
