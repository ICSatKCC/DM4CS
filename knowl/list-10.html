<li><div class="para">It should be clear that every flow augmenting path leads to a flow of increased value and that none of the capacities of the network can be violated.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The depth-first search should be used to find flow augmenting paths since it is far more efficient than the breadth-first search in this situation. The depth-first search differs from the breadth-first algorithm in that you sequentially visit vertices until you reach a “dead end” and then backtrack.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There have been networks discovered for which the FFA does not terminate in a finite number of steps. These examples all have irrational capacities. It has been proven that if all capacities are positive integers, the FFA terminates in a finite number of steps. See Ford and Fulkerson, Even, or Berge for details.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When you use the FFA to solve the Maximum Flow Problem by hand it is convenient to label each edge of the network with the fraction <span class="process-math">\(\frac{f_i(e)}{w(e)}\text{.}\)</span>
