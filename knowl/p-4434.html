<div class="para">The selection of <span class="process-math">\(\left\lceil \sqrt{n/2}\right\rceil\)</span> strips was made in a 1959 paper by Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley. It balances the problems that arise if the number of strips is too small or too large. If the square is divided into too few strips, some strips may be packed with vertices so that visiting them would require excessive horizontal motion. If too many strips are used, excessive vertical motion tends to be the result. An update on what is known about this algorithm is contained in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-sopowit-1983.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 42: The Traveling Salesman Problem and Minimum Matching in the Unit Square">[42]</a>.</div>
