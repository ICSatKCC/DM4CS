<div class="para">As mentioned briefly above, there is an alternative school of though as to what properties should be required of a finite-state automatonâ€™s transition function. Recall our motivating example of a C++ compiler and a legal \em <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">if</code> statement. In our description, we had the compiler in an ``expecting a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>" state; on seeing a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>, the compiler moved into an ``expecting a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore"></code> or a legal statement" state. An alternative way to view this would be to say that the compiler, on seeing a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>, could move into one of two different states: it could move to an ``expecting a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">{</code>" state <em class="emphasis">or</em> move to an ``expecting a legal statement" state. Thus, from a single state, on input <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>, the compiler has multiple moves. This alternative interpretation is not allowed by the DFA model. A second point on which one might question the DFA model is the fact that input must be consumed for the machine to change state. Think of the syntax for C++ function declarations. The return type of a function need not be specified (the default is taken to be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int</code>). The start state of the compiler when parsing a function declaration might be ``expecting a return type"; then with no input consumed, the compiler can move to the state ``expecting a legal function name". To model this, it might seem reasonable to allow transitions that do not require the consumption of input (such transitions are called <dfn class="terminology"><span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transitions</dfn>). Again, this is not supported by the DFA abstraction. There is, therefore, a second class of finite-state automata that people study, the class of nondeterministic finite-state automata.</div>
