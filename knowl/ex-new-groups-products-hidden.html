<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\)</span> , the direct product of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> factors of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{,}\)</span> is a group with <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> elements. We will take a closer look at <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3 = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</span> The elements of this group are triples of zeros and ones. Since the operation on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(+_2\text{,}\)</span> we will use the symbol + for the operation on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\)</span> . Two of the eight triples in the group are <span class="process-math">\(a =
(1, 0, 1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = (0, 0, 1)\text{.}\)</span> Their “sum” is <span class="process-math">\(a + b =
\left(1 +_2 0, 0 +_2 0, 1 +_2 1\right)
= (1, 0, 0)\text{.}\)</span> One interesting fact about this group is that each element is its own inverse. For example <span class="process-math">\(a + a = (1, 0, 1) + (1, 0, 1)
= (0, 0,
0)\text{;}\)</span> therefore <span class="process-math">\(-a = a\text{.}\)</span> We use the additive notation for the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> because we are using a form of addition. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\{(0, 0, 0), (1,
0, 1)\}\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\)</span> Write out the “addition” table for this set and apply <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-of-finite-group.html" title="Theorem 11.5.5: Condition for a Subgroup of Finite Group">Theorem 11.5.5</a>. The same can be said for any set consisting of (0, 0, 0) and another element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\)</span>
