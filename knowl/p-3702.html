<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Assume that <span class="process-math">\([G;\bullet ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([H;\diamond ]\)</span> are groups. The following are reasons for <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> to be not isomorphic.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> do not have the same cardinality. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}
\times \mathbb{Z}_5\)</span> can't be isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{50}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([\mathbb{R};+]\)</span> can't be isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\left[\mathbb{Q}^+ ; \cdot \right]\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is abelian and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is not abelian since <span class="process-math">\(a \bullet b = b
\bullet a\)</span> is always true in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(T(a) \diamond T(b) = T(b) \diamond T(a)\)</span> would not always be true. We have seen two groups with six elements that apply here. They are <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_6\)</span> and the group of <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 3\)</span> rook matrices (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-rook-matrices.html" title="Exercise 11.2.4.5">Exercise 11.2.4.5</a>). The second group is non-abelian, therefore it can't be isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_6\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has a certain kind of subgroup that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> doesn't have. Part (c) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-isomorphism-properties.html" title="Theorem 11.7.14: Properties of Isomorphisms">Theorem 11.7.14</a> states that this cannot happen if <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left[\mathbb{R}^* ; \cdot
\right]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]\)</span> are not isomorphic since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^*\)</span> has a subgroup with two elements, <span class="process-math">\(\{-1, 1\}\text{,}\)</span> while the proper subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span> are all infinite (convince yourself of this fact!).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The number of solutions of <span class="process-math">\(x \bullet x = e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is not equal to the number of solutions of <span class="process-math">\(y \diamond y = e'\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_8\)</span> is not isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(x +_8 x = 0\)</span> has two solutions, 0 and 4, while <span class="process-math">\(y + y = (0, 0, 0)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(y\in \mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\)</span> If the operation in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is defined by a table, then the number of solutions of <span class="process-math">\(x
\bullet x = e\)</span> will be the number of occurrences of <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in the main diagonal of the table. The equations <span class="process-math">\(x^3 = e\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x^4= e, \dots\)</span> can also be used in the same way to identify pairs of non-isomorphic groups.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">One of the cyclic subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> (i. e., <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is cyclic), while none of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span>'s cyclic subgroups equals <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> (i. e., <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is noncyclic). This is a special case of Condition c. <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}
\times \mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not isomorphic since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}
\times \mathbb{Z}\)</span> is not cyclic.</div></li>
