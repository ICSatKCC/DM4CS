<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((4) \Rightarrow (1)\)</span> Assume that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> contains no cycles and that the addition of an edge creates a cycle. All that we need to prove to verify that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a tree is that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is connected. If it is not connected, then select any two vertices that are not connected. If we add an edge to connect them, the fact that a cycle is created implies that a second path between the two vertices can be found which is in the original graph, which is a contradiction.</div>
