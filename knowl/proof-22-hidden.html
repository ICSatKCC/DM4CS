<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">If you were to encounter this theorem outside the context of a discussion of mathematical induction, it might not be obvious that the proof can be done by induction. Recognizing when an induction proof is appropriate is mostly a matter of experience. Now on to the proof!</div> <div class="para">Basis:  Since 2 is a prime, it is already decomposed into primes (one of them).</div> <div class="para">Induction:  Suppose that for some <span class="process-math">\(n \geq  2\)</span> all of the integers <span class="process-math">\(2,3, . . . , n\)</span> have a prime decomposition.  Notice the course-of-value hypothesis.  Consider <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\text{.}\)</span> Either <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> is prime or it isnâ€™t.   If <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> is prime, it is already decomposed into primes. If not, then <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> has a divisor, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> other than 1 and <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(n + 1 = c d\)</span> where both <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are between 2 and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> By the induction hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> have prime decompositions, <span class="process-math">\(c_1 c_2 \cdots  c_s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d_1 d_2 \cdots d_t\)</span> , respectively. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> has the prime decomposition <span class="process-math">\(c_1 c_2 \cdots  c_s d_1 d_2 \cdots  d_t\text{.}\)</span>
