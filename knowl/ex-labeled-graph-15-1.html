</h4> <div class="para">A flowchart is a common example of a simple graph that requires labels for its vertices and some of its edges. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-labeled-graph-15-1.html" title="Figure 15.1.14">Figure 15.1.14</a> is one such example that illustrates how many problems are solved.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/fig-labeled-graph-15-1.png" class="contained" alt="A flow chart - an example of a labeled graph"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">15.1.14<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A flow chart - an example of a labeled graph</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">At the start of the problem-solving process, we are at the vertex labeled “Start” and at the end (if we are lucky enough to have solved the problem) we will be at the vertex labeled “End.” The sequence of vertices that we pass through as we move from “Start” to “End” is called a path. The “Start” vertex is called the initial vertex of the path, while the “End” is called the final, or terminal, vertex. Suppose that the problem is solved after two attempts; then the path that was taken is <span class="process-math">\(\text{Start}, R, A, Q, L, A, Q, \text{End}\text{.}\)</span> An alternate path description would be to list the edges that were used: <span class="process-math">\(1, 2, 3,
\text{No}, 4, 3, \text{Yes}\text{.}\)</span> This second method of describing a path has the advantage of being applicable for multigraphs. On the graph in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-multigraph-ex1.html" title="Figure 15.1.7">Figure 15.1.7</a>, the vertex list <span class="process-math">\(1,2,3,4,3\)</span> does not clearly describe a path between 1 and 3, but <span class="process-math">\(e_1,e_4, e_6, e_7\)</span> is unambiguous.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s-graphs-introduction.html#ex-labeled-graph-15-1">in-context</a></span>
