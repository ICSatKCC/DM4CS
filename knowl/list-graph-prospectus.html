<div class="introduction"><div class="para">The question “Once you have a graph, what do you do with it?” might come to mind. The following list of common questions and comments about graphs is a partial list that will give you an overview of the remainder of the chapter.</div></div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">How can a graph be represented as a data structure for use on a computer? We will discuss some common data structures that are used to represent graphs in Section 13.2.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given two vertices in a graph, does there exist a path between them? The existence of a path between any or all pairs of vertices in a graph will be discussed in Section 13.3. A related question is: How many paths of a certain type or length are there between two vertices?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Is there a path (or circuit) that passes through every vertex (or uses every edge) exactly once? Paths of this kind are called traversals. We will discuss traversals in Section 13.4.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose that a cost is associated with the use of each vertex and/or edge in a path. What is the “cheapest” path, circuit, or traversal of a given kind? Problems of this kind will be discussed in Section 13.5.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given the specifications of a graph, or the graph itself, what is the best way to draw the graph? The desire for neatness alone makes this a reasonable question, but there are other motivations. Another goal might be to avoid having edges of the graph cross one another. This is discussed in Section 13.6.</div></li>
