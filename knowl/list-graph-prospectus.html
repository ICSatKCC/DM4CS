<div class="introduction"><div class="para">The question “Once you have a graph, what do you do with it?” might come to mind. The following list of common questions and comments about graphs is a partial list that will give you an overview of the remainder of the chapter.</div></div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">How can a graph be represented as a data structure for use on a computer? We will discuss some common data structures that are used to represent graphs in <a href="s-data-structures-for-graphs.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.2: Data Structures for Graphs">Section 15.2</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given two vertices in a graph, does there exist a path between them? The existence of a path between any or all pairs of vertices in a graph will be discussed in <a href="s-Connectivity.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.3: Connectivity">Section 15.3</a>. A related question is: How many paths of a certain type or length are there between two vertices?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Is there a path (or circuit) that passes through every vertex (or uses every edge) exactly once? Paths of this kind are called traversals. We will discuss traversals in <a href="s-traversals.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.4: Traversals: Eulerian and Hamiltonian Graphs">Section 15.4</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose that a cost is associated with the use of each vertex and/or edge in a path. What is the “cheapest” path, circuit, or traversal of a given kind? Problems of this kind will be discussed in <a href="s-graph-optimization.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.5: Graph Optimization">Section 15.5</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given the specifications of a graph, or the graph itself, what is the best way to draw the graph? The desire for neatness alone makes this a reasonable question, but there are other motivations. Another goal might be to avoid having edges of the graph cross one another. This is discussed in <a href="s-planarity-and-colorings.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.6: Planarity and Colorings">Section 15.6</a>.</div></li>
