<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Consider the string <span class="process-math">\(x+y*z\text{.}\)</span>  To show that this string is in the language <span class="process-math">\(L(G_1)\text{,}\)</span> we can exhibit a derivation of the string from the start symbol <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span>  For example:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
E\amp \YIELDS E+E\\
\amp \YIELDS E+E*E\\
\amp \YIELDS E+y*E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+y*E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+y*z
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">This derivation shows that the string <span class="process-math">\(x+y*z\)</span> is in fact in <span class="process-math">\(L(G_1)\text{.}\)</span> Now, this string has many other derivations.  At each step in the derivation, there can be a lot of freedom about which rule in the grammar to apply next.  Some of this freedom is clearly not very meaningful.  When faced with the string <span class="process-math">\(E+E*E\)</span> in the above example, the order in which we replace the <span class="process-math">\(E\text{'}s\)</span> with the variables <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> doesn’t much matter.  To cut out some of this meaningless freedom, we could agree that in each step of a derivation, the non-terminal symbol that is replaced is the leftmost non-terminal symbol in the string.  A derivation in which this is true is called a <dfn class="terminology">left derivation</dfn>.  The following left derivation of the string <span class="process-math">\(x+y*z\)</span> uses the same production rules as the previous derivation, but it applies them in a different order:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
E\amp \YIELDS E+E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+E*E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+y*E\\
\amp \YIELDS x+y*z
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">It shouldn’t be too hard to convince yourself that any string that has a derivation has a left derivation (which can be obtained by changing the order in which production rules are applied).</div>
