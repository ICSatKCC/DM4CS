<div class="para">There are a lot of cases to consider but it is not necessary to make a major production of this. Do row operations till you obtain a matrix in echelon form or reduced echelon form and determine whether there is a solution. If there is, see if there are free variables. In this case, there will be infinitely many solutions. Find them by assigning different parameters to the free variables and obtain the solution. If there are no free variables, then there will be a unique solution which is easily determined once the augmented matrix is in echelon or row reduced echelon form. In every case, the process yields a straightforward way to describe the solutions to the linear system. As indicated above, you are probably less likely to become confused if you place the augmented matrix in row reduced echelon form rather than just echelon form.</div>
