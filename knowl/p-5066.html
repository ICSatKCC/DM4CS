<div class="para">It should be fairly clear that this new machine accepts exactly those strings of the form <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(r_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \in L(r_2)\text{:}\)</span> first of all, any string of this form will be accepted because <span class="process-math">\(x\in L(r_1)\)</span> implies there is a path that consumes <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(q_{01}\)</span> to a final state of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\text{;}\)</span> a <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transition moves to <span class="process-math">\(q_{02}\text{;}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(y \in L(r_2)\)</span> implies there is a path that consumes <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(q_{02}\)</span> to a final state of <span class="process-math">\(M_2\text{;}\)</span> and the final states of <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> are the final states of the new machine, so <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> will be accepted. Conversely, suppose <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is accepted by the new machine. Since the only final states of the new machine are in the old <span class="process-math">\(M_2\text{,}\)</span> and the only way to get into <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> is to take a <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transition from a final state of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(z=xy\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> takes the machine from its start state to a final state of <span class="process-math">\(M_1\text{,}\)</span> a <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transition occurs, and then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> takes the machine from <span class="process-math">\(q_{02}\)</span> to a final state of <span class="process-math">\(M_2\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, <span class="process-math">\(x\in
L(r_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \in L(r_2)\text{.}\)</span>
