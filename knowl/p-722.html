<div class="para">You might guess that each cookie can be assigned to one of four possible kids and by <a href="section2_1-the-rule-of-products.html#rule-of-products" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.1.2: The Rule Of Products">The Rule Of Products</a> the answer should be <span class="process-math">\(4^7\text{.}\)</span> However, this doesnâ€™t work. Consider a few possible outcomes: we could assign the first six cookies to kid A, and the seventh cookie to kid B. Another outcome would assign the first cookie to kid B and the six remaining cookies to kid A. Both outcomes are included in the <span class="process-math">\(4^7\)</span> answer. But because the cookies are identical, both of those outcomes are really the same, kid A gets six cookies and kid B gets one cookie.</div>
