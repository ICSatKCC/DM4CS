<div class="para">One way of describing the grammatical structure of the strings in a language is to use a mathematical formalism called a <dfn class="terminology">regular expression</dfn>. A regular expression is a pattern that ``matches" strings that have a particular form. For example, consider the language (over alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma = \ab\)</span>) <span class="process-math">\(L= \{x \ | \ x
\mbox{ starts and ends with } a\}\text{.}\)</span> What is the symbol-by-symbol structure of strings in this language? Well, they start with an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> followed by zero or more <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s or both, followed by an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> The regular expression <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot (a \REOR b)^* \cdot a\)</span> is a pattern that captures this structure and matches any string in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(\cdot\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(^*\)</span> have their usual meanings, and <span class="process-math">\(\REOR\)</span> designates <em class="emphasis">or</em>.) <aside class="aside aside-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Or Notation.</span></h4>
<div class="para">Various symbols have been used to represent the ``or’’ operation in regular expressions. Both <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cup\)</span> have been used for this purpose. In this chapter, we use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(|\)</span> because it is commonly used in computer implementations of regular expressions.</div></aside> Conversely, consider the regular expression <span class="process-math">\((a\cdot(a\REOR b)^*) \REOR ((a\REOR b)^*\cdot a)\text{.}\)</span> This is a pattern that matches any string that either has the form ``<span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> followed by zero or more <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s or both" (i.e. any string that starts with an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>) <em class="emphasis">or</em> has the form ``zero or more <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s or both followed by an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>" (i.e. any string that ends with an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>). Thus the regular expression <em class="emphasis">generates</em> the language of all strings that start or end (or both) in an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{:}\)</span> this is the set of strings that match the regular expression.</div>
