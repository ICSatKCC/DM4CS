<div class="para">At this point, our subsequent reasoning might be a bit clearer if we give explicit names to <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0,w)\)</span> (the state <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> reaches on input <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>) and <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0,x)\)</span> (the state <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> reaches on input <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>). Call <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0, w)\)</span> \ <span class="process-math">\(q_w\text{,}\)</span> and call <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0,x)\)</span> \ <span class="process-math">\(q_x\text{.}\)</span> We know, because <span class="process-math">\(w=xa\text{,}\)</span> there must be an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-transition from <span class="process-math">\(q_x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(q_w\text{.}\)</span> Look at how we added transitions to <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{:}\)</span> the fact that there is an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-transition from <span class="process-math">\(q_x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(q_w\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(q_w\)</span> corresponds to the set <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_1,a)
\cup \ldots \cup \partial^*(p_n,a)\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>’s states. By our preliminary observation, <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_1,a) \cup \ldots \cup
\partial^*(p_n,a)\)</span> is just <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(q_w\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(\delta^*(q_0,w)\)</span>) corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(\partial^*(p_0,w)\text{,}\)</span> which is what we wanted to prove. Since <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> was an arbitrary string of length <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{,}\)</span> we have shown that the property holds for <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span>
