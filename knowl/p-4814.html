<div class="para">Although the tape is infinite, only a finite number of cells can be non-blank at any given time. If you don’t like the idea of an infinite tape, you can think of a finite tape that can be extended to an arbitrarily large size as the Turing machine computes: If the Turing machine gets to either end of the tape, it will pause and wait politely until you add a new section of tape.  In other words, it’s not important that the Turing machine have an infinite amount of memory, only that it can use as much memory as it needs for a given computation, up to any arbitrarily large size.   In this way, a Turing machine is like a computer that can ask you to buy it a new disk drive whenever it needs more storage space to continue a computation.<aside class="aside aside-like"></aside>
