<div class="para">To do this, we first make the state <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> into our start state, because the DFA will be in the start state after consuming the empty string <span class="process-math">\(\varep\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span> has an even number (zero) of both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. Now we add transitions by reasoning about how the parity of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s is changed by additional input. For instance, if the machine is in <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> (meaning an even number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s have been seen) and a further <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is consumed, then we want the machine to move to state <span class="process-math">\(q_3\text{,}\)</span> since the machine has now consumed an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and still an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. So we add the transition <span class="process-math">\(\delta(q_1, a) = q_3\)</span> to the machine. Similarly, if the machine is in <span class="process-math">\(q_2\)</span> (meaning an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s have been seen) and a further <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is consumed, then we want the machine to move to state <span class="process-math">\(q_3\)</span> again, since the machine has still consumed an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s, and now an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s. So we add the transition <span class="process-math">\(\delta(q_2, b) = q_3\)</span> to the machine. Similar reasoning produces a total of eight transitions, one for each state-input pair. Finally, we have to decide which states should be final states. The only state that corresponds to the desired criteria for the language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(q_1\text{,}\)</span> so we make <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> a final state. The complete machine is shown below. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/fsa5.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Transition diagram from description above"></div>
