<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Assume your instructor told you “If you receive a grade of 95 or better in the final examination, then you will receive an A in this course.” Your instructor has made a promise to you. If you fulfill his condition, you expect the conclusion (getting an A) to be forthcoming. Suppose your graded final has been returned to you. Has your instructor told the truth or is your instructor guilty of a falsehood?</div> <div class="para">Case I: Your final exam score was less than 95 (the condition is false) and you did not receive an A (the conclusion is false). The instructor told the truth.</div> <div class="para">Case II: Your final exam score was less than 95, yet you received an A for the course. The instructor told the truth. (Perhaps your overall course average was excellent.)</div> <div class="para">Case III: Your final exam score was greater than 95, but you did not receive an A. The instructor lied.</div> <div class="para">Case IV: Your final exam score was greater than 95, and you received an A. The instructor told the truth.</div> <div class="para">To sum up, the only case in which a conditional proposition is false is when the condition is true and the conclusion is false.</div></article></body>
