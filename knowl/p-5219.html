<div class="para">Although the language generated by a context-free grammar is defined in terms of derivations, there is another way of presenting the generation of a string that is often more useful. A <dfn class="terminology">parse tree</dfn> displays the generation of a string from the start symbol of a grammar as a two dimensional diagram. Here are two parse trees that show two derivations of the string <span class="process-math">\(x+y*z\)</span> according to the grammar <span class="process-math">\(G_1\text{,}\)</span> which was given at the beginning of this section: <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">17.5.12<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure> A parse tree is made up of terminal and non-terminal symbols, connected by lines.  The start symbol is at the top, or “root,” of the tree.  Terminal symbols are at the lowest level, or “leaves,” of the tree.  (For some reason, computer scientists traditionally draw trees with leaves at the bottom and root at the top.) A production rule <span class="process-math">\(A\PRODUCES w\)</span> is represented in a parse tree by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> lying above all the symbols in <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> with a line joining <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to each of the symbols in <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  For example, in the left parse tree above, the root, <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> is connected to the symbols <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(+\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> and this corresponds to an application of the production rule <span class="process-math">\(E\PRODUCES E+E\text{.}\)</span>
