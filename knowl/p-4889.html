<div class="para">In this section we will begin our study of recurrence relations and their solutions. Our primary focus will be on the class of finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients (shortened to finite order linear relations). First, we will examine closed form expressions from which these relations arise. Second, we will present an algorithm for solving them. In later sections we will consider some other common relations (<a href="s-some-common-rrs.html" class="internal" title="Section 16.2: Some Common Recurrence Relations">Section 16.2</a>) and introduce an additional tool for studying recurrence relations: generating functions (<a href="s-generating-functions.html" class="internal" title="Section 16.3: Generating Functions">Section 16.3</a> ).</div>
