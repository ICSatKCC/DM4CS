<div class="para">Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be the vertices of our graph, <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> the edges, and <span class="process-math">\(E_u\)</span> the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph <span class="process-math">\(G' =
\left(V, E - E_u\right)\text{.}\)</span> Note that every vertex in <span class="process-math">\(G'\)</span> has an even degree. Select any edge, <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(G'.\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_b\)</span> be the vertices that <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> connects. Trace a new path starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> whose first edge is <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since <span class="process-math">\((V, E)\)</span> is connected. Starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\text{,}\)</span> there exists a path in <span class="process-math">\((V, E)\)</span> to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in <span class="process-math">\(G'\)</span> is even, any path that we start at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-path-augmentation.html" title="Figure 15.4.8">FigureÂ 15.4.8</a>). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.</div>
