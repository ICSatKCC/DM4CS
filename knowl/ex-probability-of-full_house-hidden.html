<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">In a standard deck of <span class="process-math">\(52\)</span> cards, each card has a <em class="emphasis">suit</em> and a <em class="emphasis">rank</em>. There are four suits (spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds), and 13 ranks (Ace, <span class="process-math">\(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\text{,}\)</span> Jack, Queen, and King). A hand of five cards is called a <em class="emphasis">full house</em>, if three of the cards are of the same rank and the other two cards are also of the same (but necessarily different) rank. For example, the hand: <blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">7 of spades , 7 of hearts , 7 of diamonds , Q of spades , Q of clubs</div></blockquote> is a full house, because it consists of three sevens and two Queens.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Assume we get a uniformly random hand of five cards. What is the probability that this hand is a full house? To answer this question, first observe that a hand of five cards is a <em class="emphasis">subset</em> of the set of all <span class="process-math">\(52\)</span> cards. Thus, the sample space is the set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> consisting of all <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-element subsets of the set of <span class="process-math">\(52\)</span> cards and, therefore,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
|S| = {{52} \choose 5} = 2,598,960 .

<div class="para">Each hand of five cards has a probability of <span class="process-math">\(1/|S|\)</span> of being chosen.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Since we are interested in the probability of a random hand being a full house, we define the event <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to be the set of all elements in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that are full houses.

<div class="para">Thus, to determine <span class="process-math">\(P(A)\text{,}\)</span> it remains to determine the size of the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> i.e., the total number of full houses.
