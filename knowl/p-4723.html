<div class="para">Parts 1 and 2 follow from the fact that <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDSTAR\)</span> is the transitive closure of <span class="process-math">\(\YIELDS\text{.}\)</span> Part 4 follows easily from Part 3. (I leave this as an exercise.) To prove Part 3, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> are strings such that <span class="process-math">\(x\YIELDS
y\text{.}\)</span> By definition, this means that there exist strings <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and a production rule <span class="process-math">\(A\PRODUCES w\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x=uAv\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=uwv\text{.}\)</span> But then we also have <span class="process-math">\(sxt=suAvt\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(syt=suwvt\text{.}\)</span> These two equations, along with the existence of the production rule <span class="process-math">\(A\PRODUCES w\)</span> show, by definition, that <span class="process-math">\(sxt\YIELDS
syt\text{.}\)</span>
