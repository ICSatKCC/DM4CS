<div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">By the reflexive property, each vertex must be related to itself, so the arrows from a vertex to itself (called “self-loops”) are not drawn in a Hasse diagram. They are simply assumed.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">By the antisymmetry property, connections between two distinct elements in a directed graph can only go one way, if at all.  When there is a connection, we agree to always place the second element above the first (as we do above with the connection from <span class="process-math">\(\{1\}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2\}\)</span>). For this reason, we can just draw a connection without an arrow, just a line.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">By the transitive property, if there are edges connecting one element up to a second element and the second element up to a third element, then there will be a direct connection from the first to the third. We see this in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-graph-10-2-subsets-2.html" title="Figure 10.2.6">Figure 10.2.6</a> with <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> connected to <span class="process-math">\(\{1\}\)</span><span class="process-math">\(\)</span>and then <span class="process-math">\(\{1\}\)</span> connected to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2\}\text{.}\)</span> Notice the edge connecting <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2\}\text{.}\)</span>  Whenever we identify this situation, remove the connection from the first to the third in a Hasse diagram and simply observe that an upward path of any length implies that the lower element is related to the upper one.</div></li>
