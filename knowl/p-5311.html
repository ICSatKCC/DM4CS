<div class="para">The halting problem is just one of many problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines or computer programs.  In fact, almost any interesting yes/no question that can be asked about Turing machines or programs is in this class:  Does this Turing machine halt for all possible inputs in <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma^*\text{?}\)</span>  Given this input, will this program ever halt?  Do these two programs (or Turing machines) have the same output for each possible input?  Will this Turing machine ever halt if it is started on a blank tape? All these problems are computationally unsolvable in the sense that there is no Turing machine or computer program that will answer them correctly in all cases. The existence of such problems is a real limitation on the power of computation.</div>
