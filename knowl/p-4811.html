<div class="para">Historically, the theoretical study of computing began before computers existed.  One of the early models of computation was developed in the 1930s by the British mathematician, Alan Turing, who was interested in studying the theoretical abilities and limitations of computation. His model for computation is a very simple abstract computing machine which has come to be known as a <dfn class="terminology">Turing machine</dfn>.  While Turing machines are not applicable in the same way that regular expressions, finite-state automata, and grammars are applicable, their use as a fundamental model for computation means that every computer scientist should be familiar with them, at least in a general way.</div>
