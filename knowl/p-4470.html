<div class="para">When a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is concatenated with itself, the notation <span class="process-math">\(SS\)</span> is usually scrapped in favour of <span class="process-math">\(S^2\text{;}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(S^2\)</span> is concatenated with <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(S^3\)</span> for the resulting set, etc. So <span class="process-math">\(S^2\)</span> is the set of all strings formed by concatenating two (possibly different, possibly identical) strings from <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S^3\)</span> is the set of strings formed by concatenating three strings from <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> etc. Extending this notation, we take <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> to be the set of strings formed from one string in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> (i.e.\ <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> itself), and <span class="process-math">\(S^0\)</span> to be the set of strings formed from zero strings in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> (i.e.\ <span class="process-math">\(S^0 = \{\varep\}\)</span>). If we take the union <span class="process-math">\(S^0 \cup
S^1 \cup S^2 \cup \ldots\text{,}\)</span> then the resulting set is the set of all strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and is denoted <span class="process-math">\(S^*\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(S^*\)</span> is called the <em class="emphasis">Kleene closure</em> of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(^*\)</span> operator is called the <em class="emphasis">Kleene star</em> operator.</div>
