<div class="para">Our primary interest in Turing machines is as language processors. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is a string over an alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{.}\)</span>  We will assume that <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\)</span> does not contain the blank symbol.  We can use <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> as input to a Turing machine <span class="process-math">\(M=(Q,\Lambda,q_0,\delta)\)</span> provided that <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\SUB\Lambda\text{.}\)</span>  To use <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> as input for <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> we will write <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span>’s tape and assume that the remainder of the tape is blank. We place the machine on the cell containing the first character of the string, except that if <span class="process-math">\(w=\EMPTYSTRING\)</span> then we simply place the machine on a completely blank tape.   Then we start the machine in its initial state, <span class="process-math">\(q_0\text{,}\)</span> and see what computation it performs. We refer to this setup as ``running <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> with input <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>’’</div>
