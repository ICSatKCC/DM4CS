<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">Consider the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/alg-max-element.html" title="Algorithm 9.1.11: Maximum Element in a List">AlgorithmÂ 9.1.11</a> that solves the problem of finding the largest value in an array of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> integers. The algorithm looks at each integer in turn, saving the largest value seen so far. Here, the size of the problem is the number of integers stored in in the list. The basic operation is to compare an integer's value to that of the largest value seen so far. It is reasonable to assume that it takes a fixed amount of time to do one such comparison, regardless of the value of the two integers or their positions in the array.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let us call <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> the amount of time required to compare two integers in function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">MaximumElement</code>. We do not care right now what the precise value of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> might be. Nor are we concerned with the time required to increment variable <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">index</code> because this must be done for each value in the list, or the time for the actual assignment when a larger value is found, or the little bit of extra time taken to initialize <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">maximum</code>. We just want a reasonable approximation for the time taken to execute the algorithm. The total time to run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">MaximumElement</code> is therefore approximately <span class="process-math">\(cn\text{,}\)</span> because we must make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> comparisons, with each comparison costing <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> time. We say that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">MaximumElement</code> (and by extension, the largest-value sequential search algorithm for any typical implementation) has a running time expressed by the function</div>

\begin{equation*}
T(n)=cn\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">The asymptotic complexity of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">MaximumElement</code> is therefore the Big O of <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\text{.}\)</span> This is a <em class="emphasis">Linear Complexity</em> algorithm because <span class="process-math">\(T(n) = O(n)\text{.}\)</span>
