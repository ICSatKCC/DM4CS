<div class="para">This is especially interesting since most languages are not recursively enumerable. Given an alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{,}\)</span> there are uncountably many languages over <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{,}\)</span> but only countably many of them are recursively enumerable.  The rest---the vast majority---are not recursively enumerable.  What can we say about all these non-recursively-enumerable languages?  If the language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is not recursively enumerable, then there is no algorithm for listing the members of <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>  It might be possible to define <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> by specifying some property that all its members satisfy, but that property canâ€™t be computable.  That is, there can be no computer program or Turing machine that tests whether a given string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> has the property, since if there were, then we could write a program that lists the members of <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>
