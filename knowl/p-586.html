The numbers in each course, respectively, for sophomore CS majors, were 75, 60, 55. How many sophomore CS majors are there? The Law of Addition applies here. There are exactly <span class="process-math">\(75 + 60 + 55 = 190\)</span> CS majors since the rosters of the three courses listed above would be a partition of the CS majors.</div>
