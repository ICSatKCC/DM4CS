</h4>Find a DFA with input alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma = \ab\)</span> that accepts the language <span class="process-math">\(L
= \{w \in\Sigma^* \ | \ n_a(w) \mbox{ is divisible by 3 } \}\text{.}\)</span> The relevant characteristic here is of course whether or not the number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s in a string is divisible by 3, perhaps suggesting a two-state machine. But in fact, there is more than one way for a number to not be divisible by 3: dividing the number by 3 could produce a remainder of either 1 or 2 (a remainder of 0 corresponds to the number in fact being divisible by 3). So we build a machine with three states <span class="process-math">\(q_0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q_2\text{,}\)</span> and add transitions so that the machine will be in state <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> exactly when the number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s it has consumed is evenly divisible by 3, in state <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> exactly when the number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s it has consumed is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(1 \bmod{3}\text{,}\)</span> and similarly for <span class="process-math">\(q_2\text{.}\)</span> State <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> will be the start state, as <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span> has 0 <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and 0 is divisible by 3. The completed machine is shown below. Notice that because the consumption of a <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> does not affect the only relevant characteristic, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s do not cause changes of state. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
