<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Though we have used the term <em class="emphasis">string</em> throughout to refer to a sequence of symbols from an alphabet, an alternative term that is frequently used is <em class="emphasis">word</em>. The analogy seems fairly obvious: strings are made up of ``letters" from an alphabet, just as words are in human languages like English. In English, however, there are no particular rules specifying which sequences of letters can be used to form legal English words---even unlikely combinations like <em class="emphasis">ghth</em> and <em class="emphasis">ckstr</em> have their place. While some formal languages may simply be random collections of arbitrary strings, more interesting languages are those where the strings in the language all share some common structure:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{gather*}
L_1 = \{ x\in \ab^* \ | n_a(x) =
n_b(x)\};\\
L_2 = \{\mbox{legal Java identifiers}\};\\
L_3 = \{\mbox{legal C++
programs}\}.
\end{gather*}
</div>
<div class="para">In all of these languages, there are structural rules which determine which sequences of symbols are in the language and which aren’t. So despite the terminology of ``alphabet" and ``word" in formal language theory, the concepts don’t necessarily match ``alphabet" and ``word" for human languages. A better parallel is to think of the <em class="emphasis">alphabet</em> in a formal language as corresponding to the <em class="emphasis">words</em> in a human language; the <em class="emphasis">words</em> in a formal language correspond to the <em class="emphasis">sentences</em> in a human language, as there are rules (<em class="emphasis">grammar rules</em>) which determine how they can legally be constructed.</div>
