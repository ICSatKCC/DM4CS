<div class="para">The difference between binary trees and ordered trees is that every vertex of a binary tree has exactly two subtrees (one or both of which may be empty), while a vertex of an ordered tree may have any number of subtrees. But there is another significant difference between the two types of structures. The two trees in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-diff-binary-trees.html" title="Figure 14.4.4">FigureÂ 14.4.4</a> would be considered identical as ordered trees. However, they are different binary trees. Tree (a) has an empty right subtree and Tree (b) has an empty left subtree.</div>
