<div class="para">In this machine, state <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> checks whether the next character is an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> a <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> or a # (indicating the end of the string). States <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_2\)</span> add an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to the end of the new string, and states <span class="process-math">\(q_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_4\)</span> do the same thing with a <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> States <span class="process-math">\(q_5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_6\)</span> return the machine to the next character in the input string.  When the end of the input string is reached, state <span class="process-math">\(q_7\)</span> will move the machine back to the start of the input string, changing <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span>’s back to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s as it goes. Finally, when the machine hits the # that precedes the input string, it moves to the right and halts.  This leave it back at the first character of the input string.  It would be a good idea to work through the execution of this machine for a few sample input strings. You should also check that it works even for an input string of length zero.</div>
