<div class="para">The characteristics that determine whether or not a string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> are the parity of <span class="process-math">\(n_a(w)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n_b(w)\text{.}\)</span> There are four possible combinations of ``values" for these characteristics: both numbers could be even, both could be odd, the first could be odd and the second even, or the first could be even and the second odd. So we build a machine with four states <span class="process-math">\(q_1, q_2, q_3,
q_4\)</span> corresponding to the four cases. We want to set up \delta so that the machine will be in state <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> exactly when it has consumed a string with an even number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an even number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s, in state <span class="process-math">\(q_2\)</span> exactly when it has consumed a string with an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s and an odd number of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>’s, and so on.</div>
