<div class="para">At each step in its computation, the Turing machine reads the contents of the tape cell where it is located. Depending on its state and the symbol that it reads, the machine writes a symbol (possibly the same symbol) to the cell, moves one cell either to the left or to the right, and (possibly) changes its state. The output symbol, direction of motion, and new state are determined by the current state and the input symbol.  Note that either the input symbol, the output symbol, or both, can be blank. A Turing machine has a fixed set of <dfn class="terminology">rules</dfn> that tell it how to compute.  Each rule specifies the output symbol, direction of motion, and new state for some combination of current state and input symbol.  The machine has a rule for every possible combination of current state and input symbol, except that there are no rules for what happens if the current state is the halt state.  Of course, once the machine enters the halt state, its computation is complete and the machine simply stops.</div>
