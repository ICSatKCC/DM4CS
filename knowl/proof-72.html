<div class="para">I will prove only the first claim of the theorem, that <span class="process-math">\(L\cup M\)</span> is context-free. In the exercises for this section, you are asked to construct grammars for <span class="process-math">\(LM\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L^*\)</span> (without giving formal proofs that your answers are correct).</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(G=(V,\Sigma,P,S)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H=(W,\Gamma,Q,T)\)</span> be context-free grammars such that <span class="process-math">\(L=L(G)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M=L(H)\text{.}\)</span> We can assume that <span class="process-math">\(W\cap V=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> since otherwise we could simply rename the non-terminal symbols in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> The idea of the proof is that to generate a string in <span class="process-math">\(L\cup M\text{,}\)</span> we first decide whether we want a string in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> or a string in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Once that decision is made, to make a string in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> we use production rules from <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> while to make a string in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> we use rules from <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> We have to design a grammar, <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> to represent this process.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be a symbol that is not in any of the alphabets <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Gamma\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> will be the start symbol of <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> The production rules for <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> consist of all the production rules from <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> together with two new rules:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{gather*}
R\PRODUCES S\\
R\PRODUCES T 
\end{gather*}

<div class="para">Formally, <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is defined to be the grammar</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(V\cup W\cup\{R\},
P\cup Q\cup \{R\PRODUCES S, R\PRODUCES T\},
\Sigma\cup\Gamma, R)

<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\text{.}\)</span> That is <span class="process-math">\(w\in L(G)\text{,}\)</span> so there is a derivation <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS_G^*w\text{.}\)</span> Since every rule from <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is also a rule in <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> if follows that <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS_K^* w\text{.}\)</span> Combining this with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(R\YIELDS_K S\text{,}\)</span> we have that <span class="process-math">\(R\YIELDS_K^* w\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w\in L(K)\text{.}\)</span> This shows that <span class="process-math">\(L\SUB L(K)\text{.}\)</span> In an exactly similar way, we can show that <span class="process-math">\(M\SUB L(K)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(L\cup M\SUB L(K)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para">It remains to show that <span class="process-math">\(L(K)\SUB L\cup M\text{.}\)</span> Suppose <span class="process-math">\(w\in L(K)\text{.}\)</span> Then there is a derivation <span class="process-math">\(R\YIELDS_K^*w\text{.}\)</span> This derivation must begin with an application of one of the rules <span class="process-math">\(R\PRODUCES S\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(R\PRODUCES T\text{,}\)</span> since these are the only rules in which <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> appears. If the first rule applied in the derivation is <span class="process-math">\(R\PRODUCES S\text{,}\)</span> then the remainder of the derivation shows that <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS_K^*w\text{.}\)</span> Starting from <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> the only rules that can be applied are rules from <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> so in fact we have <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS_G^*w\text{.}\)</span> This shows that <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if the first rule applied in the derivation <span class="process-math">\(R\YIELDS_K^*w\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(R\PRODUCES T\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(w\in M\text{.}\)</span> In any case, <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\cup M\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(L(K)\SUB L\cup M\text{.}\)</span>
