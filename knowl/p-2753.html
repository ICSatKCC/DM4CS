<div class="para">Insertion sort works by keeping the list it is sorting in two sections, sorted and unsorted. It starts with the just the first item in the list as the sorted part and the whole rest unsorted. It then puts the second item in sorted order with the first by swapping places if the second is smaller than the first. Now the sorted part is two items long and the rest is unsorted. Then it takes the third item and puts it in its correct position in the sorted part by shifting any larger items over to make room for that item. Then it moves the sorted/unsorted boundary over. This is repeated until the whole list is included in the sorted part.</div>
