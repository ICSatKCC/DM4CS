</h4> <div class="para">The search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph is typical of many simple-sounding problems in graph theory that have proven to be very difficult to solve. Although there are simple algorithms for conducting the search, they are impractical for large problems because they take such a long time to complete as graph size increases. Currently, every algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph takes a time that grows at a rate that is greater than any polynomial as a function of the number of vertices. Rates of this type are called “<dfn class="terminology">super-polynomial</dfn> .” That is, if <span class="process-math">\(T(n)\)</span> is the time it takes to search a graph of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices, and <span class="process-math">\(p(n)\)</span> is any polynomial, then <span class="process-math">\(T(n) &gt; p(n)\)</span> for all but possibly a finite number of positive values for <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">It is an unproven but widely held belief that no faster algorithm exists to search for Hamiltonian paths in general graphs. To sum up, the problem of determining whether a graph is Hamiltonian is theoretically possible; however, for large graphs we consider it a practical impossibility. Many of the problems we will discuss in the next section, particularly the Traveling Salesman Problem, are thought to be impossible in the same sense.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s-traversals.html#note-12">in-context</a></span>
