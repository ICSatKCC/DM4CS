<div class="para">In Chapter 2, we stated that the number of different permutations of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> elements taken from an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> element set, <span class="process-math">\(P(n; k)\text{,}\)</span> can be computed with the formula <span class="process-math">\(\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\text{.}\)</span> We can prove this statement by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(n \geq  0\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(q(n)\)</span> be the proposition</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(n; k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \textrm{  for all } k \textrm{, } 0 \le k \le n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Basis: <span class="process-math">\(q(0)\)</span> states that  <span class="process-math">\(P(0; 0) \)</span> if is the number of ways that <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> elements can be selected from the empty set and arranged in order, then <span class="process-math">\(P(0; 0) = \frac{0!}{0!} = 1 \text{.}\)</span>  This is true. A general law in combinatorics is that there is exactly one way of doing nothing.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Induction: Assume that <span class="process-math">\(q(n)\)</span> is true for some natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> It is left for us to prove that this assumption implies that <span class="process-math">\(q(n +1)\)</span> is true. Suppose that we have a set of cardinality <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> and want to select and arrange <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of its elements. There are two cases to consider, the first of which is easy. If <span class="process-math">\(k = 0\text{,}\)</span> then there is one way of selecting zero elements from the set; hence</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(n + 1; 0) = 1 =\frac{(n+1)!}{(n+1+0)!}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and the formula works in this case.</div>
</div> <div class="para">The more challenging case is to verify the formula when <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is positive and less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span> Here we count the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n+ 1; k)\)</span> by counting the number of ways that the first element in the arrangement can be filled and then counting the number of ways that the remaining <span class="process-math">\(k -1\)</span> elements can be filled in using the induction hypothesis.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> possible choices for the first element. Since that leaves <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements to fill in the remaining <span class="process-math">\(k - 1\)</span> positions, there are <span class="process-math">\(P(n; k - 1)\)</span> ways of completing the arrangement. By the rule of products,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(n +1;k) &amp;= (n+1) P(n;k-1) \\
&amp; = (n+1) \frac{n!}{(n-(k-1))!} \\
&amp; = \frac{(n+1) n!}{(n-k+1)!}\\
