<div class="para">The above algorithm is the way a computer would obtain a reduced echelon form for a given matrix. It is not necessary for you to pretend you are a computer but if you like to do so, the algorithm described above will work. The main idea is to do row operations in such a way as to end up with a matrix in echelon form or row reduced echelon form because when this has been done, the resulting augmented matrix will allow you to describe the solutions to the linear system of equations in a meaningful way. When you do row operations until you obtain row reduced echelon form, the process is called the <dfn class="terminology">Gauss Jordan method</dfn>. Otherwise, it is called <dfn class="terminology">Gauss elimination</dfn>.</div>
