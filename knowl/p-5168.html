<div class="para">Itâ€™s easy to see that every string that can be generated using these rules is in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> since each rule introduces the same number of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{'s}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(b\text{'s}\text{.}\)</span> But we also need to check that every string <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> can be generated by these rules. This can be done by induction on the length of <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> using the second form of the principle of mathematical induction. In the base case, <span class="process-math">\(|w|=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w=\EMPTYSTRING\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(w\in L\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S\YIELDS\EMPTYSTRING\)</span> in one step. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(|w|=k\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\gt 0\text{,}\)</span> and suppose that we already know that for any <span class="process-math">\(x\in L\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(|x|
\lt k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR x\text{.}\)</span> To finish the induction we must show, based on this induction hypothesis, that <span class="process-math">\(S\;\YIELDSTAR w\text{.}\)</span>
