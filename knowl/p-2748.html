<div class="para">Bubble sort is very simple. It runs through the list to be sorted several times, comparing neighboring pairs of items. If the first item is larger than the second, they swap places. Then it moves forward and compares the next pair, and so on. This causes the largest item in the list to “bubble down” to its correct sorted position at the end of the list in the first pass through to list. In the next pass through the list, the second largest item will end up in its correct sorted position (second from the end). In the third pass, the third largest item will be in its sorted position, and so on. Each time the algorithm passes through the list, it can stop looking for swaps sooner,  when it gets to the previously placed items. The algorithm has to make almost as many passes through the list as there are items in it. In each pass execept the last, only one item is guaranteed to be put into its correct position. In the final pass, the last two smallest items are correctly placed because there are only two positions left at that point. The algorithm finishes after making <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> passes through the list, if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the length of the list it sorted.</div>
