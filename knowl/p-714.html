<div class="para">In the card game Blackjack, there are one or more players and a dealer.  Initially, each player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card down and one facing up.  As in bridge, the order of the hands, but not the order of the cards in the hands, matters.  Starting with a single 52 card deck, and three players, how many ways can the first two cards be dealt out?  You can use the sage cell in the <a href="section2_4-combinations-and-the-binomial-theorem.html#sage-bridge-hands" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.4.3: SageMath Note">SageMath Note</a> to do this calculation.</div>
