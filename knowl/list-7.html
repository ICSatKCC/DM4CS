This coach will know who sent him a letter, and so on. Therefore, the vertex list of the desired path is constructed in reverse order.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">This method could be extended to construct a list of all teams that a given team can be connected to. Simply imagine a series of letters like the one above sent by each football coach and targeted at every other coach.</div></li>
