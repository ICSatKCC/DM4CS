<div class="para">One set of subgraphs of any graph is the connected components of a graph. For simplicity, we will define them for undirected graphs. Given a graph <span class="process-math">\(G=(V,E)\text{,}\)</span> consider the relation “is connected to” on <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We interprete this relation so that each vertex is connected to itself, and any two distinct vertices are related if there is a path along edges of the graph from one to the other. It shouldn’t be too difficult to convince yourself that this is an equivalence relation on <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>
