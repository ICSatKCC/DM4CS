<div class="para">The 3-cube and its generalization, the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-cube, play a role in the design of a multiprocessor called a hypercube. A multiprocessor is a computer that consists of several independent processors that can operate simultaneously and are connected to one another by a network of connections. In a hypercube with <span class="process-math">\(M=2^n\)</span> processors, the processors are numbered 0 to <span class="process-math">\(M-1\text{.}\)</span> Two processors are connected if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit. The hypercube has proven to be the best possible network for certain problems requiring the use of a “supercomputer.”</div>
