</h5> <div class="para">Note that for the simplest regular expressions, the machines that we created to accept the languages generated by the regular expressions were in fact DFAs. In our last case above, however, we needed <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transitions to build the new machine, and so if we were trying to prove that every regular language could be accepted by a DFA, our proof would be in trouble. THIS DOES NOT MEAN that the statement ``every regular language can be accepted by a DFA" is false, just that we canâ€™t prove it using this kind of argument, and would have to find an alternative proof.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-FSA-and-Regular-Languages.html#remark-2">in-context</a></span>
