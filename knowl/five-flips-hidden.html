<div class="para">We determine the total number of ordered ways a fair coin can land if tossed five consecutive times. The five tosses can produce any one of the following mutually exclusive, disjoint events: 5 heads, 4 heads, 3 heads, 2 heads, 1 head, or 0 heads.  For example, by the previous example, there are <span class="process-math">\(\binom{5}{3}=10\)</span> sequences in which three heads appear. Counting the other possibilities in the same way, by the law of addition we have:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\binom{5}{5}+\binom{5}{4}+\binom{5}{3}+\binom{5}{2}+\binom{5}{1}+\binom{5}{0}= 1 + 5 +10+10+5+1 = 32
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">ways to observe the five flips.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Of course, we could also have applied the extended rule of products, and since there are two possible outcomes for each of the five tosses, we have <span class="process-math">\(2^5 = 32\)</span> ways.</div></article></body>
