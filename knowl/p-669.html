<div class="para">In bridge, the location of a hand in relation to the dealer has some bearing on the game. An even truer indication of the number of possible hands takes into account <span class="process-math">\(each\)</span>  playerâ€™s possible hand. It is customary  to refer to bridge positions as West, North, East and South. We can apply the rule of product to get the total number of bridge hands with the following logic. West can get any of the <span class="process-math">\(\binom{52}{13}\)</span> hands identified above. Then North get 13 of the remaining 39 cards and so has  <span class="process-math">\(\binom{39}{13}\)</span> possible hands. East then gets 13 of the 26 remaining cards, which has <span class="process-math">\(\binom{26}{13}\)</span>  possibilities. South gets the remaining cards. Therefore the number of bridge hands is computed using the Product Rule.</div>
