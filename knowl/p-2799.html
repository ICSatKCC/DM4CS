<div class="para">There are two base cases. The first base case is when all possible elements have been compared and the target is not found. This occurs when the <em class="emphasis">begin</em> position is greater than the <em class="emphasis">end</em> position, no elements are left to examine so -1 is returned. The second base case is when the target is found, the middle element is equal to the target and the location of that middle element is returned. There are also two recursive cases, one for if the target is larger than the middle element and one for if the target is smaller than the middle element. If the target is larger than the middle, the recursive call will look at the upper half of the remaining list, if the target is smaller than the middle element, the other recursive call looks at the lower half of the remaining list.</div>
