<div class="para">Assume an evenly balanced coin is tossed five times. In how many ways can three heads be obtained? This is a combination problem, because the order in which the heads appear does not matter. We can think of this as a situation involving sets by considering the set of flips of the coin, 1 through 5, in which heads comes up.   The number of ways to get three heads is <span class="process-math">\(\binom{5}{3}= \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\text{.}\)</span>
