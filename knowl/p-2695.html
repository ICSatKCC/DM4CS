<div class="para">The most familiar method for multiplying large numbers, at least for American students, is the <em class="emphasis">lattice algorithm</em>. This algorithm was popularized by the medieval Italian mathematician and tradesman Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, in his 1202 book <em class="emphasis">Liber Abaci</em>. Fibonacci learned it from Arabic sources including al-Khwarizmi who in turn learned it from Indian sources, who may have learned it from Chinese sources. The oldest surviving descriptions of the algorithm appear in The Mathematical Classic of Sunzi, written in China between the 3rd and 5th centuries, and in Eutocius of Ascalon's commentaries on Archimedes' Measurement of the Circle, written around 500ce, but there is evidence that the algorithm was known much earlier.</div>
