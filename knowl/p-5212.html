<div class="para">The fact that <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> is an unambiguous grammar means that at each step in a left derivation for a string <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> there is only one production rule that can be applied which will lead ultimately to a correct derivation of <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  However, <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> actually satisfies a much stronger property:  at each step in the left derivation of <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> we can tell which production rule has to be applied by looking ahead at the next symbol in <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  We say that <span class="process-math">\(G_2\)</span> is an <dfn class="terminology">LL(1) grammar</dfn>. (This notation means that we can read a string from <dfn class="terminology">L</dfn>eft to right and construct a <dfn class="terminology">L</dfn>eft derivation of the string by looking ahead at most <dfn class="terminology">1</dfn> character in the string.) Given an LL(1) grammar for a language, it is fairly straightforward to write a computer program that can parse strings in that language. If the language is a programming language, then parsing is one of the essential steps in translating a computer program into machine language. LL(1) grammars and parsing programs that use them are often studied in courses in programming languages and the theory of compilers.</div>
