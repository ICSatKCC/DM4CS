<div class="para">Languages are sets and therefore, as for any sets, it makes sense to talk about the union, intersection, and complement of languages. (When taking the complement of a language over an alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{,}\)</span> we always consider the univeral set to be <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma^*\text{,}\)</span> the set of all strings over <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\text{.}\)</span>) Because languages are sets of strings, there are additional operations that can be defined on languages, operations that would be meaningless on more general sets. For example, the idea of concatenation can be extended from strings to languages.</div>
