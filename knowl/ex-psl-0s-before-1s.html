</h3> <div class="para">We can define the set of all strings over <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> for which all 0's precede all 1's as follows. Define the starting symbol <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and establish rules that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be replaced with any of the following: <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0S\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(S1\text{.}\)</span> These replacement rules are usually called production rules. They are usually written in the format <span class="process-math">\(S\to \lambda\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(S\to 0S\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\to S1\text{.}\)</span> Now define <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> to be the set of all strings that can be produced by starting with <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and applying the production rules until <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> no longer appears. The strings in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> are exactly the ones that are described above.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-free-monoids-and-languages.html#ex-psl-0s-before-1s" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
