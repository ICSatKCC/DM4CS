<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">The Monty Hall Problem is a well-known puzzle in probability theory. It is named after the host, Monty Hall, of the American television game show <em class="emphasis">Let’s Make a Deal</em>. The problem became famous in 1990, when (part of) a reader’s letter was published in Marilyn vos Savant’s column <em class="emphasis">Ask Marilyn</em> in the magazine <em class="emphasis">Parade</em>: <blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to switch?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</div></blockquote>
</div> <div class="para">Note that the host can always open a door that has a goat behind it. After the host has opened No.3, we know that the car is either behind No.1 or No.2, and it seems that both these doors have the same probability (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(50\%\)</span>) of having the car behind them. We will prove below, however, that this is not true: It is indeed to our advantage to switch our choice.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We assume that the car is equally likely to be behind any of the three doors. Moreover, the host knows what is behind each door.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">We initially choose one of the three doors uniformly at random; this door remains closed.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The host opens one of the other two doors that has a goat behind it.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Our final choice is to switch to the other door that is still closed.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be the event that we win the car and let <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be the event that the initial door has a goat behind it. Then it is not difficult to see that event <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> occurs if and only if event <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> occurs. Therefore, the probability that we win the car is equal to</div>

P(A) = P(B) = 2/3 .
