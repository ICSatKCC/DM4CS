<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-dodec-graph.html" title="Figure 15.4.14">Figure 15.4.14</a> shows a graph that is Hamiltonian. In fact, it is the graph that Hamilton used as an example to pose the question of existence of Hamiltonian paths in 1859. In its original form, the puzzle that was posed to readers was called “Around the World.” The vertices were labeled with names of major cities of the world and the object was to complete a tour of these cities. The graph is also referred to as the dodecahedron graph, where vertices correspond with the corners of a dodecahedron and the edges are the edges of the solid that connect the corners.</div>
