<div class="para">Like context-free grammars, BNF grammars make use of production rules, non-terminals, and terminals.  The non-terminals are usually given meaningful, multi-character names.  Here, I will follow a common practice of enclosing non-terminals in angle brackets, so that they can be easily distinguished.  For example, <span class="process-math">\(\langle noun \rangle\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\langle sentence \rangle\)</span> could be non-terminals in a BNF grammar for English, while <span class="process-math">\(\langle program \rangle\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\langle if{\text -}statement \rangle\)</span> might be used in a BNF grammar for a programming language.  Note that a BNF non-terminal usually represents a meaningful <dfn class="terminology">syntactic category</dfn>, that is, a certain type of building block in the syntax of the language that is being described, such as an adverb, a prepositional phrase, or a variable declaration statement. The terminals of a BNF grammar are the things that actually appear in the language that is being described.  In the case of natural language, the terminals are individual words.</div>
