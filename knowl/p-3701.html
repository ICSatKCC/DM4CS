<div class="para">How do you decide that two groups are not isomorphic to one another? The negation of “<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> are isomorphic” is that no translation rule between <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> exists. If <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> have different cardinalities, then no bijection from <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> can exist. Hence they are not isomorphic. Given that <span class="process-math">\(\left|
G\right| =\left| H\right|\text{,}\)</span> it is usually impractical to list all bijections from <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> and show that none of them satisfy Condition b of the formal definition. The best way to prove that two groups are not isomorphic is to find a true statement about one group that is not true about the other group. We illustrate this method in the following checklist that you can apply to most pairs of non-isomorphic groups in this book.</div>
