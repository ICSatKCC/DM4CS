<div class="para">We do this by showing that there is no threshold value for the language. Let <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> be an arbitrary candidate for threshold value. We want to show that it is not in fact a threshold value, so we want to find a string in the language whose length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and which can’t be broken down in the way described by the Pumping Lemma. What string should we try to prove unbreakable? We can’t pick strings like <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> because we’re working with an arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> i.e.\ making no assumptions about <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>’s value; picking <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> is implicitly assuming that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is no bigger than 200 --- for larger values of <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a^{100}b^{100}\)</span> would not be ``a string whose length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span>". Whatever string we pick, we <em class="emphasis">have</em> to be sure that its length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> no matter what number <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is. So we pick, for instance, <span class="process-math">\(w = a^Nb^N\text{.}\)</span> This string is in the language, and its length is at least <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> no matter what number <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is. If we can show that this string can’t be broken down as described by the Pumping Lemma, then we’ll have shown that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> doesn’t work as a threshold value, and since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> was an arbitrary number, we will have shown that there is no threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is not regular. So let’s show that <span class="process-math">\(w =
a^Nb^N\)</span> can’t be broken down appropriately.</div>
