<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(p_1= \left(e_1, e_2, \ldots , e_m \right)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p_2=\left(f_1,f_2,\ldots
, f_n\right)\)</span> be two different simple paths from <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v_b\text{.}\)</span> The first step we will take is to delete from <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p_2\)</span> the initial edges that are identical. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(e_1= f_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e_2= f_2,
\dots \text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e_{j}= f_j\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e_{j+1}\neq f_{j+1}\)</span> delete the first <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> edges of both paths. Once this is done, both paths start at the same vertex, call it <span class="process-math">\(v_c\text{,}\)</span> and both still end at <span class="process-math">\(v_b\text{.}\)</span> Now we construct a cycle by starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_c\)</span> and following what is left of <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> until we first meet what is left of <span class="process-math">\(p_2\text{.}\)</span> If this first meeting occurs at vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_d\text{,}\)</span> then the remainder of the cycle is completed by following the portion of the reverse of <span class="process-math">\(p_2\)</span> that starts at <span class="process-math">\(v_d\)</span> and ends at <span class="process-math">\(v_c\text{.}\)</span>
