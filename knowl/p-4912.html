<div class="para">Regular languages, then, are languages whose strings' structure can be described in a very formal, mathematical way.  The fact that a language can be ``mechanically" described or generated means that we are likely to be able to get a computer to recognize strings in that language. We will pursue the question of mechanical language recognition in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "section15_4-finite-state-automata" missing or not unique]</code>, and subsequently will see that our first attempt to model mechanical language recognition does in fact produce a family of ``machines" that recognize exactly the regular languages.  But first, in the next section, we will look at some practical applications of regular expressions.</div>
