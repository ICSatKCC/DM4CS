By trial and error, abc, abd, acd, and bcd are the only listings possible. To repeat, we were looking for all three-element subsets of the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Order is not important in sets. The notation for choosing 3 elements from 4 is most commonly <span class="process-math">\(\binom{4}{3}\)</span> or occasionally <span class="process-math">\(C(4,3)\text{,}\)</span> either of which is read “4 choose 3” or the number of combinations for four objects taken three at a time.</div></article></body>
