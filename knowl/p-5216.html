<div class="para">At this point, we have the configuration <span class="process-math">\((T|+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  The <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> could be the right-hand side of the production rule <span class="process-math">\(E\PRODUCES T\text{.}\)</span> However, it could also conceivably come from the rule <span class="process-math">\(T\PRODUCES T*F\text{.}\)</span> How do we know whether to reduce the <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> at this point or to wait for a <span class="process-math">\(*F\)</span> to come along so that we can reduce <span class="process-math">\(T*F\,\text{?}\)</span> We can decide by looking ahead at the next character after the cursor.  Since this character is a <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> rather than a <span class="process-math">\(*\text{,}\)</span> we should choose the reduce operation that replaces <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> giving <span class="process-math">\((E|+y)*z\text{.}\)</span>  What makes <span class="process-math">\(G_3\)</span> an LR(1) grammar is the fact that we can always decide what operation to apply by looking ahead at most one symbol past the cursor.</div>
