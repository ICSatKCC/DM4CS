<div class="para">The search for an efficient algorithm that solves the Traveling Salesman has occupied researchers for years. If the graph in question is complete, there are <span class="process-math">\((n -1)!\)</span> different circuits. As <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> gets large, it is impossible to check every possible circuit. The most efficient algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem take an amount of time that is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(n 2^n\text{.}\)</span> Since this quantity grows so quickly, we can't expect to have the time to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for large values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Most of the useful algorithms that have been developed have to be heuristic; that is, they find a circuit that should be close to the optimal one. One such algorithm is the “closest neighbor” algorithm, one of the earliest attempts at solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The general idea behind this algorithm is, starting at any vertex, to visit the closest neighbor to the starting point. At each vertex, the next vertex that is visited is the closest one that has not been reached. This shortsighted approach typifies heuristic algorithms called greedy algorithms, which attempt to solve a minimization (maximization) problem by minimizing (maximizing) the quantity associated with only the first step.</div>
