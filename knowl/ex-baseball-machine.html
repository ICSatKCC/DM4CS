</h3> <div class="para">Consider the following simplified version of the game of baseball. To be precise, this machine describes one half-inning of a simplified baseball game. Suppose that in addition to home plate, there is only one base instead of the usual three bases. Also, assume that there are only two outs per inning instead of the usual three. Our input alphabet will consist of the types of hits that the batter could have: out (O), double play (DP), single (S), and home run (HR). The input DP is meant to represent a batted ball that would result in a double play (two outs), if possible. The input DP can then occur at any time. The output alphabet is the numbers 0, 1, and 2 for the number of runs that can be scored as a result of any input. The state set contains the current situation in the inning, the number of outs, and whether a base runner is currently on the base. The list of possible states is then 00 (for 0 outs and 0 runners), 01, 10, 11, and end (when the half-inning is over). The transition diagram for this machine appears in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-baseball-machine.html" title="Figure 15.3.13">FigureÂ 15.3.13</a>

If the current state is 01, 0 outs and 1 runner on base, each input results in a different combination of output and next-state. If the batter hits the ball poorly (a double play) the output is zero runs and the inning is over (the limit of two outs has been made). A simple out also results in an output of 0 runs and the next state is 11, one out and one runner on base. If the batter hits a single, one run scores (output = 1) while the state remains 01. If a home run is hit, two runs are scored (output = 2) and the next state is 00. If we had allowed three outs per inning, this graph would only be marginally more complicated. The usual game with three bases would be quite a bit more complicated, however.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-finite-state-automata.html#ex-baseball-machine" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
