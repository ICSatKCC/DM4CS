<div class="para">Consider a telephone network in which the main office <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is connected to, and can communicate to, individuals <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>  Both <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> can communicate to another person, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{;}\)</span> however, the main office cannot communicate with <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> Assume communication is only one way, as indicated. This situation can be described by the relation <span class="process-math">\(R = \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)\}\text{.}\)</span> We would like to change the system so that the main office <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> can communicate with person <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> and still maintain the previous system. We, of course, want the most economical system.</div>
