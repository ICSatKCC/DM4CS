</h3> <div class="para">In this example, we will describe how set variables can be implemented on a computer. We will describe the two systems first and then describe the isomorphism between them.</div> <div class="para">System 1: The power set of <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)</span> with the operation union, <span class="process-math">\(\cup\text{.}\)</span> For simplicity, we will only discuss union. However, the other operations are implemented in a similar way.</div> <div class="para">System 2: Strings of five bits of computer memory with an OR gate. Individual bit values are either zero or one, so the elements of this system can be visualized as sequences of five 0's and 1's. An OR gate, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-set-isomorphism.html" title="Figure 11.7.5">Figure 11.7.5</a>, is a small piece of computer hardware that accepts two bit values at any one time and outputs either a zero or one, depending on the inputs. The output of an OR gate is one, except when the two bit values that it accepts are both zero, in which case the output is zero. The operation on this system actually consists of sequentially inputting the values of two bit strings into the OR gate. The result will be a new string of five 0's and 1's. An alternate method of operating in this system is to use five OR gates and to input corresponding pairs of bits from the input strings into the gates concurrently.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/fig-set-isomorphism.png" class="contained" alt="Translation between sets and strings of bits"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">11.7.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Translation between sets and strings of bits</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between sets and bit strings is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If <span class="process-math">\(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\text{,}\)</span> is a bit string in System 2, the set that it translates to contains the number <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> equals 1. For example, <span class="process-math">\(10001\)</span> is translated to the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 5\}\text{,}\)</span> while the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2\}\)</span> is translated to <span class="process-math">\(11000.\)</span> Now imagine that your computer is like the child who knows English and must do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that includes the set expression <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2\} \cup \{1, 5\}\text{,}\)</span> it will follow the same procedure as the child to obtain the result, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-set-calculation.html" title="Figure 11.7.6">Figure 11.7.6</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/fig-set-calculation.png" class="contained" alt="Translation of a problem in set theory"></div>
