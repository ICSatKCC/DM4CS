<div class="para">The nice thing about this grammar is that the precedence rules for the operators are implicit in the grammar.  For example, according to the grammar, the expression <span class="process-math">\(3+5*7\)</span> is seen as <span class="process-math">\(\langle term \rangle\)</span> + <span class="process-math">\(\langle term \rangle\)</span> where the first term is <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and the second term is <span class="process-math">\(5*7\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(5*7\)</span> occurs as a group, which must be evaluated before the result is added to <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span>  Parentheses can change the order of evaluation.  For example, <span class="process-math">\((3+5)*7\)</span> is generated by the grammar as a single <span class="process-math">\(\langle term \rangle\)</span> of the form <span class="process-math">\(\text{.}\)</span> The first <span class="process-math">\(\langle factor \rangle\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((3+5)\text{.}\)</span>  When <span class="process-math">\((3+5)*7\)</span> is evaluated, the value of <span class="process-math">\((3+5)\)</span> is computed first and then multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span>  This is an example of how a grammar that describes the syntax of a language can also reflect its meaning.</div>
