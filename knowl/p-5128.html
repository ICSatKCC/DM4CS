<div class="para">We need to show that you can’t write <span class="process-math">\(w = a^Nb^N\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(w=xyz\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> together contain at most <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> symbols, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> isn’t empty, and all the strings <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyyz\text{,}\)</span> etc.\ are still in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> i.e. of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\)</span> for some number~<span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The best way to do this is to show that any choice for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> being whatever precedes it and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> being whatever follows) that satisfies the first two requirements fails to satisfy the third. So what are our possible choices for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{?}\)</span> Well, since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> together can contain at most <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> symbols, and <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> starts with <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s, both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must be made up entirely of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s; since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can’t be empty, it must contain at least one <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and (from (i)) no more than <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s. So the possible choices for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(y=a^k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(1
\leq k \leq N\text{.}\)</span> We want to show now that none of these choices will satisfy the third requirement by showing that for any value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> at least one of the strings <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyz\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(xyyyz\text{,}\)</span> etc will not be in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> No matter what value we try for <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> we don’t have to look far for our rogue string: the string <span class="process-math">\(xz\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(a^Nb^N\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s deleted from it, looks like <span class="process-math">\(a^{N-k}b^N\text{,}\)</span> which is clearly not of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^nb^n\text{.}\)</span> So the only <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>’s that satisfy (i) and (ii) don’t satisfy (iii); so <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> can’t be broken down as required; so <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is not a threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{;}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> was an arbitrary number, there is no threshold value for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{;}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is not regular.</div>
