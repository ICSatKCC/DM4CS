<li><div class="para">The integers with addition is a group. We know that addition is associative. Zero is the identity for addition: <span class="process-math">\(0 + n = n + 0 = n\)</span> for all integers <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The additive inverse of any integer is obtained by negating it. Thus the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-n\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The integers with multiplication is not a group. Although multiplication is associative and 1 is the identity for multiplication, not all integers have a multiplicative inverse in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> For example, the multiplicative inverse of 10 is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{10}\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{10}\)</span> is not an integer.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The power set of any set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> with the operation of symmetric difference, <span class="process-math">\(\oplus\text{,}\)</span> is a group. If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are sets, then <span class="process-math">\(A\oplus B=(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\text{.}\)</span> We will leave it to the reader to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\oplus\)</span> is associative over <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}(U)\text{.}\)</span> The identity of the group is the empty set: <span class="process-math">\(A\oplus \emptyset = A\text{.}\)</span> Every set is its own inverse since <span class="process-math">\(A \oplus A = \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}(U)\)</span> is not a group with union or intersection.</div></li>
