<div class="para">When BNF is applied to programming languages, the terminal symbols are generally “tokens,” which are the minimal meaningful units in a program.  For example, the pair of symbols <span class="process-math">\(\lt =\)</span> constitute a single token, as does a string such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">"Hello World"</code>. Every number is represented by a single token.  (The actual value of the number is stored as a so-called “attribute” of the token, but the value plays no role in the context-free syntax of the language.) I will use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\textbf{number}\)</span> to represent a numerical token. Similarly, every variable name, subroutine name, or other identifier in the program is represented by the same token, which I will denote as <span class="process-math">\(\textbf{ident}\text{.}\)</span>  One final complication:  Some symbols used in programs, such as “]” and “(”, are also used with a special meaning in BNF grammars.  When such a symbol occurs as a terminal symbol, I will enclose it in double quotes.  For example, in the BNF production rule</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\langle array{\text -}reference \rangle ::=\ 
\textbf{ident } \text{"[" } \langle expression \rangle \text{ "]"} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">the “<span class="process-math">\([\)</span>” and “<span class="process-math">\(]\)</span>” are terminal symbols in the language that is being described, rather than the BNF notation for an optional item.  With this notation, here is part of a BNF grammar that describes statements in the Java programming language:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\langle statement \rangle \amp ::=\ \langle block{\text -}statement \rangle \BNFALT\ \langle if{\text -}statement \rangle \\
\amp \,\BNFALT\ \langle while{\text -}statement\rangle  \BNFALT\ \langle assignment{\text -}statement \rangle\\
\amp \,  \BNFALT\ \langle null{\text -}statement \rangle\\
\langle block{\text -}statement \rangle\amp ::=\ \{ [ \langle statement \rangle ]\dots\ \}\\
\langle if{\text -}statement \rangle \amp ::=\ if \text{"("} \langle condition \rangle \text{")"}  \langle statement \rangle [ else \langle statement \rangle~] \\
\langle while{\text -}statement \rangle \amp ::=\ while \text{"("}  \langle condition \rangle \text{")"} \langle statement \rangle \\
\langle assignment{\text -}statement \rangle \amp  ::=\ \langle variable \rangle = \langle expression \rangle ; \\
\langle null{\text -}statement \rangle\amp ::=\ \EMPTYSTRING 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">The non-terminals <span class="process-math">\(\langle condition \rangle\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\langle variable \rangle\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\langle expression \rangle\)</span> would, of course, have to be defined by other production rules in the grammar.  Here is a set of rules that define simple expressions, made up of numbers, identifiers, parentheses and the arithmetic operators <span class="process-math">\(+, -, *\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(/\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\langle expression \rangle \amp ::=\ \langle term \rangle [ \,[ + | - ] \langle term \rangle ]\dots\\
\langle term \rangle \amp ::=\ \langle factor \rangle [ \, [ * | / ] \langle factor \rangle ]\dots \\
\langle factor \rangle  \amp ::=\ \textbf{ident} | \textbf{number} | \text{"}(\text{"}\langle expression \rangle \text{"})\text{"}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">The first rule says that an <span class="process-math">\(\langle expression \rangle\)</span> is a sequence of one or more <span class="process-math">\(\langle term \rangle\)</span>’s, separated by plus or minus signs. The second rule defines a <span class="process-math">\(\langle term \rangle\)</span> to be a sequence of one or more <span class="process-math">\(\langle factors \rangle\text{,}\)</span> separated by multiplication or division operators. The last rule says that a <span class="process-math">\(\langle factor \rangle\)</span> can be either an identifier or a number or an <span class="process-math">\(\langle expression \rangle\)</span> enclosed in parentheses. This small BNF grammar can generate expressions such as “<span class="process-math">\(3*5\)</span>” and</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x*(x+1) - 3/(z+2*(3-x)) + 7\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The latter expression is made up of three terms: <span class="process-math">\(x*(x+1)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3/(z+2*(3-x))\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span>  The first of these terms is made up of two factors, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+1)\text{.}\)</span>  The factor <span class="process-math">\((x+1)\)</span> consists of the expression <span class="process-math">\(x+1\)</span> inside a pair of parentheses.</div>
