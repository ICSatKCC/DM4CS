<div class="para">We do not have time to look at enough examples to convince you that Turing machines are as powerful as computers, but the proof reduces to the fact that computers are actually fairly simple in their basic operation.  Everything that a computer does comes down to copying data from one place to another, making simple comparisons between two pieces of data, and performing some basic arithmetic operations. It’s possible for Turing machines to do all these things.  In fact, it’s possible to build a Turing machine to simulate the step-by-step operation of a given computer.  Doing so proves that the Turing machine can do any computation that the computer could do, although it will, of course, work much, much more slowly.</div>
