</h4>
<div class="para">Your favorite mathematical pizza chain offers 10 toppings. How many pizzas can you make if you are allowed 6 toppings? The order of toppings does not matter but now you are allowed repeats. So one possible pizza is triple sausage, double pineapple, and onions.</div>
<div class="solutions"><details class="solution solution-like"><summary><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like">
<div class="para">We get 6 toppings (counting possible repeats). Represent each of these toppings as a star. Think of going down the menu one topping at a time: you see anchovies first, and skip to the next, sausage. You say yes to sausage 3 times (use 3 stars), then switch to the next topping on the list. You keep skipping until you get to pineapple, which you say yes to twice. Another switch and you are at onions. You say yes once. Then you keep switching until you get to the last topping, never saying yes again (since you already have said yes 6 times. There are 10 toppings to choose from, so we must switch from considering one topping to the next 9 times. These are the bars.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now that we are confident that we have the right number of stars and bars, we answer the question simply: there are 6 stars and 9 bars, so 15 symbols. We need to pick 9 of them to be bars, so there number of pizzas possible is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{15 \choose 9} =  \frac{15!}{(15-9)!9!} = \frac{15*14*13*12*11*10}{6*5*4*3*2*1} = 5005\text{.}
