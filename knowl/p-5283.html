<div class="para">It is easy to prove the converse, and the proof is left as an exercise. So we see that a language is Turing-decidable if and only if both it and its complement are Turing-acceptable.  Since Turing-acceptability can be defined using other forms of computation besides Turing machines, so can Turing-decidability.  For example, a language is Turing-decidable if and only if both it and its complement can be generated by general grammars. We introduced the term ``recursively enumerable’’ as a synonym for Turing-acceptable, to get away from the association with a particular form of computation.  Similarly, we define the term ``recursive’’ as a synonym for Turing-decidable.  That is, a language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is said to be <dfn class="terminology">recursive</dfn> if and only if it is Turing-decidable.  We then have the theorem:</div>
