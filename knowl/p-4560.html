<div class="para">Starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G-v\text{,}\)</span> suppose we try to construct a path <span class="process-math">\(v_3\)</span> that passes through only red and blue vertices. This can either be accomplished or it can't be accomplished. If it can't be done, consider all paths that start at <span class="process-math">\(v_1\text{,}\)</span> and go through only red and blue vertices. If we exchange the colors of the vertices in these paths, including <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> we still have a 5-coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G - v\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> is now blue, we can color the central vertex, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> red.</div>
