<div class="para">The examples that we will look at in this section involve Turing machines that work with other Turing machines as data.  For this to work, we need a symbolic representation of Turing machines---a representation that can be written on the tape of another Turing machine.  This will let us create two machines:  First, a Turing machine that can generate Turing machines on demand by writing their symbolic representations on its tape. We will design a Turing machine <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> to do this.  And second, a Turing machine that can simulate the computation of other Turing machines whose descriptions are written on its tape.</div>
