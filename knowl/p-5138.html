<div class="para">In every context-free grammar, one of the non-terminal symbols is designated as the <dfn class="terminology">start symbol</dfn> of the grammar. The start symbol is often, though not always, denoted by <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> When the grammar is used to generate strings in a language, the idea is to start with a string consisting of nothing but the start symbol. Then a sequence of production rules is applied. Each application of a production rule to the string transforms the string to a new string. If and when this process produces a string that consists purely of terminal symbols, the process ends. That string of terminal symbols is one of the strings in the language generated by the grammar. In fact, the language consists precisely of all strings of terminal symbols that can be produced in this way.</div>
