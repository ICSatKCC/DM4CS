<div class="para">The Maximum Flow Problem is derived from the objective of moving the maximum amount of water or other material from the source to the sink. To measure this amount, we define a flow as a function <span class="process-math">\(f: E \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> such that (1) the flow of material through any edge is nonnegative and no larger than its capacity: <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq f(e) \leq w(e)\text{,}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(e\in E\text{;}\)</span> and (2) for each vertex other than the source and sink, the total amount of material that is directed into a vertex is equal to the total amount that is directed out:</div>
