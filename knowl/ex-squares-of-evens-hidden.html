To do this indirectly, assume <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even and that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd, and reach a contradiction.

<li><div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(\Leftarrow \)</span>) If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even, then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even. To do this directly, assume that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even and prove that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even.</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">Now that we have broken the theorem down into two parts and know what to prove, we proceed to prove the two implications. The final ingredient that we need is a convenient way of describing even integers. When we refer to an integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,.}\)</span> . . ) as even, we can always replace it with a product of the form <span class="process-math">\(2q\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is an integer (more precisely, <span class="process-math">\(\left.(\exists q) _{\mathbb{Z}} (n = 2q)\right)\text{.}\)</span> In other words, for an integer to be even it must have a factor of two in its prime decomposition.</div></article></body>
