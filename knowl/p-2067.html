<div class="para">The computation of a product can take a considerable amount of time in comparison to the time required to add two matrices. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrices; then <span class="process-math">\((A B)_{ij}\)</span> is determined performing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> multiplications and <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> additions. The full product takes <span class="process-math">\(n^3\)</span> multiplications and <span class="process-math">\(n^3 - n^2\)</span> additions. This compares with <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> additions for the sum of two <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrices. The product of two 10 by 10 matrices will require 1,000 multiplications and 900 additions, clearly a job that you would assign to a computer. The sum of two matrices requires a more modest 100 additions. This analysis is based on the assumption that matrix multiplication will be done using the formula that is given in the definition. There are more advanced methods that, in theory, reduce operation counts. For example, Strassen's algorithm (<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen\_algorithm</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>) computes the product of two <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> matrices in <span class="process-math">\(7\cdot 7^{\log _2n}-6\cdot  4^{\log _2n}\approx  7 n^{2.808}\)</span> operations. There are practical issues involved in actually using the algorithm in many situations.  For example, round-off error can be more of a problem than with the standard formula.</div>
