<div class="para">It should be fairly clear that every language that is accepted by a DFA is also accepted by an NFA. Pictorially, a DFA looks exactly like an NFA (an NFA that doesnâ€™t happen to have any <span class="process-math">\(\varep\)</span>-transitions or multiple same-label transitions from any state), though there is slightly more going on behind the scenes. Formally, given the DFA <span class="process-math">\(M=(Q,
\Sigma, q_0, \delta, F)\text{,}\)</span> you can build an NFA <span class="process-math">\(M'=(Q, \Sigma, q_0, \partial, F)\)</span> where 4 of the 5 components are the same and where every transition <span class="process-math">\(\delta(q,a) = q'\)</span> has been replaced by <span class="process-math">\(\partial(q,a) = \{q'\}\text{.}\)</span>
