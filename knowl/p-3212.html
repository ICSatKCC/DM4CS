<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\bullet \)</span> is a binary operation on <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in S\text{,}\)</span> there are three common ways of denoting the image of the pair <span class="process-math">\((a, b)\text{.}\)</span> They are:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\bullet a b &amp; a\bullet b &amp; a b \bullet \\
\textrm{ Prefix Form} &amp; \textrm{ Infix Form} &amp; \textrm{ Postfix Form} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">We are all familiar with infix form. For example, <span class="process-math">\(2 + 3\)</span> is how everyone is taught to write the sum of 2 and 3. But notice how <span class="process-math">\(2 + 3\)</span> was just described in the previous sentence! The word sum preceded 2 and 3. Orally, prefix form is quite natural to us. The prefix and postfix forms are superior to infix form in some respects. In Chapter 14, we will see that algebraic expressions with more than one operation don't need parentheses if they are in prefix or postfix form. However, due to our familiarity with infix form, we will use it throughout most of the remainder of this book.</div>
