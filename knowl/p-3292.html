<div class="para">As illustrated above, such a system of linear equations may have a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions and these are the only three cases which can occur for any linear system. Furthermore, you do exactly the same things to solve any linear system. You write the augmented matrix and do row operations until you get a simpler system in which it is possible to see the solution, usually obtaining a matrix in echelon or reduced echelon form. All is based on the observation that the row operations do not change the solution set. You can have more equations than variables, fewer equations than variables, etc. It doesnâ€™t matter. You always set up the augmented matrix and go to work on it.</div>
