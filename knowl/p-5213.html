<div class="para">Not every unambiguous context-free grammar is an LL(1) grammar.  Consider, for example, the following grammar, which I will call <span class="process-math">\(G_3\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
E \amp \PRODUCES E + T\\
E \amp \PRODUCES T\\
T \amp \PRODUCES T * F\\
T \amp \PRODUCES F\\
F \amp \PRODUCES (E)\\
F \amp \PRODUCES x\\
F \amp \PRODUCES y\\
F \amp \PRODUCES z
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">This grammar generates the same language as <span class="process-math">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G_2\text{,}\)</span> and it is unambiguous.  However, it is not possible to construct a left derivation for a string according to the grammar <span class="process-math">\(G_3\)</span> by looking ahead one character in the string at each step. The first step in any left derivation must be either <span class="process-math">\(E\YIELDS E+T\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(E\YIELDS T\text{.}\)</span>  But how can we decide which of these is the correct first step? Consider the strings <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z+z*x\text{,}\)</span> which are both in the language <span class="process-math">\(L(G_3)\text{.}\)</span>  For the string <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z\text{,}\)</span> the first step in a left derivation must be <span class="process-math">\(E\YIELDS T\text{,}\)</span> while the first step in a left derivation of <span class="process-math">\((x+y)*z+z*x\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(E\YIELDS E+T\text{.}\)</span>  However, the first seven characters of the strings are identical, so clearly looking even seven characters ahead is not enough to tell us which production rule to apply.  In fact, similar examples show that looking ahead any given finite number of characters is not enough.</div>
