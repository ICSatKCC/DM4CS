<div class="para">What formalism might we use to model what it means to recognize a language ``mechanically’’? We look for inspiration to a language-recognizer with which we are all familiar, and which we’ve already in fact mentioned: a compiler. Consider how a C++ compiler might handle recognizing a legal <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">if</code> statement. Having seen the word <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">
            if</code>, the compiler will be in a <em class="emphasis">state</em> or <em class="emphasis">phase of its execution</em> where it expects to see a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(</code>; in this state, any other character will put the compiler in a ``failure" state. If the compiler does in fact see a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(</code> next, it will then be in an ``expecting a boolean condition" state; if it sees a sequence of symbols that make up a legal boolean condition, it will then be in an ``expecting a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>" state; and then ``expecting a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">{</code>’ or a legal statement"; and so on. Thus one can think of the compiler as being in a series of states; on seeing a new input symbol, it moves on to a new state; and this sequence of transitions eventually leads to either a ``failure" state (if the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">if</code> statement is not syntactically correct) or a ``success" state (if the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">if</code> statement is legal). We isolate these three concepts---states, input-inspired transitions from state to state, and ``accepting" vs ``non-accepting" states---as the key features of a mechanical language-recognizer, and capture them in a model called a <dfn class="terminology">finite-state automaton</dfn>. (Whether this is a successful distillation of the essence of mechanical language recognition remains to be seen; the question will be taken up later in this chapter.) <aside class="aside aside-like"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Automata.</span></h3>
<div class="para">The term <dfn class="terminology">automata</dfn> is the plural form of <dfn class="terminology">automaton</dfn>. In some texts, <dfn class="terminology">machine</dfn> is used in place of automaton.</div></aside>
