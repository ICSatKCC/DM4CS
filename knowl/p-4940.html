<div class="para">In applications of regular expressions, the alphabet usually includes all the characters on the keyboard.  This leads to a problem, because regular expressions actually use two types of symbols:  symbols that are members of the alphabet and special symbols such a ``<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code>’’ and ``<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">)</code>’’ that are used to construct expressions.  These special symbols, which are not part of the language being described but are used in the description, are called <dfn class="terminology">meta-characters</dfn>.  The problem is, when the alphabet includes all the available characters, what do we do about meta-characters?  If the language that we are describing uses the ``<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code>’’ character, for example, how can we represent the Kleene star operation?</div>
