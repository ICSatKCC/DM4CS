</h4> <div class="para">Suppose that an organization is divided into three geographic sections, A, B, and C. Suppose that an executive committee of 11 members must be selected so that no more than 5 members from any one section are on the committee and that Sections A, B, and C must have minimums of 3, 2, and 2 members, respectively, on the committee. Looking only at the number of members from each section on the committee, how many ways can the committee be made up? One example of a valid committee would be 4 A's, 4 B's, and 3 C's.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P_A\)</span> be the action of deciding how many members (not who) from Section A will serve on the committee. <span class="process-math">\(X_A= \{3, 4, 5\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_A(k)=k\text{.}\)</span> The frequency function, <span class="process-math">\(F_A\)</span> , is defined by <span class="process-math">\(F_A(k)=1\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(k\in X_k\)</span> , with <span class="process-math">\(F_A(k)=0\)</span> otherwise. <span class="process-math">\(G\left(F_A;z\right)\)</span> is then <span class="process-math">\(z^3+
z^4+z^5\)</span> . Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(G\left(F_B;z\right) =z^2+ z^3+ z ^4 + z^5=
G\left(F_C ;z\right)\text{.}\)</span> Since the committee must have 11 members, our answer will be the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(z^{11}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\left(F_A;z\right)G\left(F_B;z\right)G\left(F_C;z\right)\text{,}\)</span> which is 10.</div> <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-59"><script type="text/x-sage">var('z')
