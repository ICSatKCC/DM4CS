We have seen that the machine of the monoid of the parity checker is essentially the parity checker. Will we obtain a unit-time delay machine when we construct the machine of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{?}\)</span> We can't expect to get exactly the same machine because the unit-time delay machine is not a state machine and the machine of a monoid is a state machine. However, we will see that our new machine is capable of telling us what input was received in the previous time period. The operation table for the monoid serves as a table to define the transition function for the machine. The row headings are the state values, while the column headings are the inputs. If we were to draw a transition diagram with all possible inputs, the diagram would be too difficult to read. Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is generated by the two elements, <span class="process-math">\(T_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{,}\)</span> we will include only those inputs. Suppose that we wanted to read the transition function for the input <span class="process-math">\(T_{01}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(T_{01}=T_0T_1\text{,}\)</span> in any state <span class="process-math">\(s, t\left(s, T_{01}\right) =
