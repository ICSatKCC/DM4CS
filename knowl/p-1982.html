<div class="para">In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition <span class="process-math">\(\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}\text{.}\)</span> An example of a set that could not be produced from just <span class="process-math">\(B_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2\)</span> is the set of even elements of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{-2,0,2\}\text{.}\)</span> This is because <span class="process-math">\(-2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> cannot be separated. They are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are <span class="process-math">\(2^3= 8\)</span> different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5=32\)</span> subsets of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> could be generated from  any two sets <span class="process-math">\(B_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2\text{.}\)</span>
