<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a grammar for the language <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>  That is, <span class="process-math">\(L=L(G)\text{.}\)</span>  The grammar <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> can be used to generate strings in the language~<span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>  In practice, though, we often start with a string which might or might not be in~<span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> and the problem is to determine whether the string is in the language and, if so, how it can be generated by <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  The goal is to find a derivation of the string, using the production rules of the grammar, or to show that no such derivation exists.  This is known as <dfn class="terminology">parsing</dfn> the string.  When the string is a computer program or a sentence in a natural language, parsing the string is an essential step in determining its meaning.</div>
