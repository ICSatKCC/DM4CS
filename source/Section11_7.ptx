    <introduction>
        <p>The following informal definition of isomorphic systems should be memorized. No matter
            how technical a discussion about isomorphic
            systems becomes, keep in mind that this is the essence of the concept.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Two algebraic systems are isomorphic if there exists a translation rule between
                    them so that any
                    true statement in one system can be translated to a true statement in the other.</p>

            <title>How to Do Greek Arithmetic</title>
            <p>Imagine that you are a six-year-old child who has been reared in an English-speaking
                family, has moved to Greece, and has been enrolled in a Greek school. Suppose that
                your new teacher asks the class to do the following addition problem that has been
                written out in Greek. <me>\tau \rho \acute{\iota} \alpha \quad \sigma \upsilon \nu
                \quad \tau \acute{\epsilon} \sigma \sigma \varepsilon \rho \alpha \quad \iota \sigma
                o \acute{\upsilon} \tau \alpha \iota \quad \_\_\_\_</me> The natural thing for you
                to do is to take out your Greek-English/English-Greek dictionary and translate the
                Greek words to English, as outlined in <xref ref="fig-greek-sum" text="type-global" />
                After you've solved the problem, you can consult the same dictionary to find the
                proper Greek word that the teacher wants. Although this is not the recommended
                method of learning a foreign language, it will surely yield the correct answer to
                the problem. Mathematically, we may say that the system of Greek integers with
                addition (<m>\sigma \upsilon \nu</m>) is isomorphic to English integers with
                addition (plus). The problem of translation between natural languages is more
                difficult than this though, because two complete natural languages are not
                isomorphic, or at least the isomorphism between them is not contained in a simple
                dictionary.</p>

            <title>Software Implementation of Sets</title>
            <p>In this example, we will describe how set variables can be implemented on a computer.
                We will describe the two systems first and then describe the isomorphism between
                them.</p>

            <p>System 1: The power set of <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</m> with the operation union, <m>\cup</m>.
                For simplicity, we will only discuss union. However, the other operations are
                implemented in a similar way.</p>

            <p>System 2: Strings of five bits of computer memory with an OR gate. Individual bit
                values are either zero or one, so the elements of this system can be visualized as
                sequences of five 0's and 1's. An OR gate, <xref ref="fig-set-isomorphism"
                    text="type-global" />, is a small piece of computer hardware that accepts two
                bit values at any one time and outputs either a zero or one, depending on the
                inputs. The output of an OR gate is one, except when the two bit values that it
                accepts are both zero, in which case the output is zero. The operation on this
                system actually consists of sequentially inputting the values of two bit strings
                into the OR gate. The result will be a new string of five 0's and 1's. An alternate
                method of operating in this system is to use five OR gates and to input
                corresponding pairs of bits from the input strings into the gates concurrently.</p>

            <p>The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and
                the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between sets and bit strings
                is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If <m>
                a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5</m>, is a bit string in System 2, the set that it translates to
                contains the number <m>k</m> if and only if <m>a_k</m> equals 1. For example, <m>
                10001</m> is translated to the set <m>\{1, 5\}</m>, while the set <m>\{1, 2\}</m> is
                translated to <m>11000.</m> Now imagine that your computer is like the child who
                knows English and must do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that
                includes the set expression <m>\{1, 2\} \cup \{1, 5\}</m>, it will follow the same
                procedure as the child to obtain the result, as shown in <xref
                    ref="fig-set-calculation" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>This isomorphism is between<m>\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]</m> and <m>
                [\mathbb{R};+]</m>. Until the 1970s, when the price of calculators dropped,
                multiplication and exponentiation were performed with an isomorphism between these
                systems. The isomorphism <m>\left(\mathbb{R}^+\right.</m> to <m>\mathbb{R}</m>)
                between the two groups is that <m>\cdot</m> is translated into <m>+</m> and any
                positive real number <m>a</m> is translated to the logarithm of <m>a</m>. To
                translate back from <m>\mathbb{R}</m> to <m>\mathbb{R}^+</m> , you invert the
                logarithm function. If base ten logarithms are used, an element of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>
                , <m>b</m>, will be translated to <m>10^b</m>. In pre-calculator days, the
                translation was done with a table of logarithms or with a slide rule. An example of
                how the isomorphism is used appears in <xref ref="fig-log-mult" text="type-global" />

        <p>The following definition of an isomorphism between two groups is a more formal one that
            appears in most abstract algebra texts. At first glance,
            it appears different, it is really a slight variation on the informal definition. It is
            the common definition because it is easy to apply; that is,
            given a function, this definition tells you what to do to determine whether that
            function is an isomorphism.</p>

                                ref="fig-steps-iso" text="type-global" />. The first condition, that
                            an isomorphism be a bijection, reflects the fact that every true
                            statement in the first group should have exactly one corresponding true
                            statement in the second group. This is exactly why we run into
                            difficulty in translating between two natural languages. To see how
                            Condition (b) of the formal definition is consistent with the informal
                            definition, consider the function <m>L:\mathbb{R}^+\to \mathbb{R}</m>
                            defined by <m>L(x)

                            do by computing <m>a \cdot b</m>. If we apply the function <m>L</m> to
                            the two results, we get the same image: <mdn>

        <p><q>Is isomorphic to</q> is an <xref ref="def-equivalence-relation" /> on the set of all
            groups. Therefore, the set of all groups is partitioned into equivalence classes, each
            equivalence class containing groups that are isomorphic to one another.</p>

        <title>Conditions for groups to not be isomorphic</title>

        <p>How do you decide that two groups are not isomorphic to one another? The negation of <q><m>
            G</m> and <m>H</m> are isomorphic</q> is that no translation rule between <m>G</m> and <m>
            H</m> exists. If <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> have different cardinalities, then no bijection
            from <m>G</m> into <m>H</m> can exist. Hence they are not isomorphic. Given that <m>\left|
            G\right| =\left| H\right|</m>, it is usually impractical to list all bijections from <m>
            G</m> into <m>H</m> and show that none of them satisfy Condition b of the formal
            definition. The best way to prove that two groups are not isomorphic is to find a true
            statement about one group that is not true about the other group. We illustrate this
            method in the following checklist that you can apply to most pairs of non-isomorphic
            groups in this book.</p>

        <p>Assume that <m>[G;\bullet ]</m> and <m>[H;\diamond ]</m> are groups. The following are
            reasons for <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> to be not isomorphic. <ol marker="(a)">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> do not have the same cardinality. For example, <m>\mathbb{Z}_{12}
            \times \mathbb{Z}_5</m> can't be isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}_{50}</m> and <m>
            [\mathbb{R};+]</m> can't be isomorphic to <m>\left[\mathbb{Q}^+ ; \cdot \right]</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>G</m> is abelian and <m>H</m> is not abelian since <m>a \bullet b = b
            \bullet a</m> is always true in <m>G</m>, but <m>T(a) \diamond T(b) = T(b) \diamond T(a)</m>
            would not always be true. We have seen two groups with six elements that apply here.
            They are <m>\mathbb{Z}_6</m> and the group of <m>3 \times 3</m> rook matrices (see <xref
                            ref="ex-rook-matrices" text="type-global" />). The second group is
            non-abelian, therefore it can't be isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}_6</m>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>G</m> has a certain kind of subgroup that <m>H</m> doesn't have. Part (c)
            of <xref ref="theorem-isomorphism-properties" text="type-global" /> states that this
            cannot happen if <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H</m>. <m>\left[\mathbb{R}^* ; \cdot
            \right]</m> and <m>\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]</m> are not isomorphic since <m>
            \mathbb{R}^*</m> has a subgroup with two elements, <m>\{-1, 1\}</m>, while the proper
            subgroups of <m>\mathbb{R}^+</m> are all infinite (convince yourself of this fact!).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The number of solutions of <m>x \bullet x = e</m> in <m>G</m> is not equal to
            the number of solutions of <m>y \diamond y = e'</m> in <m>H</m>. <m>\mathbb{Z}_8</m> is
            not isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3</m> since <m>x +_8 x = 0</m> has two solutions, 0
            and 4, while <m>y + y = (0, 0, 0)</m> is true for all <m>y\in \mathbb{Z}_2{}^3</m>. If
            the operation in <m>G</m> is defined by a table, then the number of solutions of <m>x
            \bullet x = e</m> will be the number of occurrences of <m>e</m> in the main diagonal of
            the table. The equations <m>x^3 = e</m>, <m>x^4= e, \dots</m> can also be used in the
            same way to identify pairs of non-isomorphic groups.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> One of the cyclic subgroups of <m>G</m> equals <m>G</m> (i. e., <m>G</m> is
            cyclic), while none of <m>H</m>'s cyclic subgroups equals <m>H</m> (i. e., <m>H</m> is
            noncyclic). This is a special case of Condition c. <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}
            \times \mathbb{Z}</m> are not isomorphic since <m>\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1\rangle</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}

                <p> Prove that all infinite cyclic groups are isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
                <p> Let <m>G</m> be an infinite cyclic group generated by <m>a</m>. Then, using
                    multiplicative notation, <m>G=\left\{\left.a^n\right| n\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}</m>.
                    The map <m>T: G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}</m> defined by <m>T\left(a^n\right)=n</m>
                    is an isomorphism. This is indeed a function, since <m>a^n=a^m</m> implies <m>n
                    =m</m>. Otherwise, <m>a</m> would have a finite order and would not generate <m>
