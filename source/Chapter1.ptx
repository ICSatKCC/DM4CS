<introduction>
<title>Goals for Chapter 1</title>
<p>We begin this chapter with a brief description of discrete mathematics.  We then cover some of the basic set language and notation that will be used throughout the text. Venn diagrams will be introduced in order to give the reader a clear picture of set operations. In addition, we will describe the binary representation of positive integers  and introduce summation notation and its generalizations.</p>
