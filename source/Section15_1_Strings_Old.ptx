	<introduction>
		<p> In computer science courses, we discuss many algorithms and computational models that
			manipulate sequences: one-dimensional arrays, linked lists, blocks of text, walks in
			graphs, sequences of executed instructions, and so on. Ultimately the input and output
			of any algorithm must be representable as a finite string of symbols—the raw contents of
			some contiguous portion of the computer's memory. Reasoning about computation requires
			reasoning about strings.</p>

		<p> This section lists several formal definitions and formal induction proofs related to
			strings. These definitions and proofs are <em>intentionally</em> much more detailed than
			normally used in practice—most people's intuition about strings is fairly accurate—but
			the extra precision is necessary for any sort of formal proof. It may be helpful to
			think of this material as part of the “assembly language” of theoretical computer
			science. We normally think about computation at a much higher level of abstraction, but
			ultimately every argument must “compile” down to these (and similar) definitions.</p>

		<p>But the actual definitions and theorems are not the point. The point of
			playing with this material is to get some experience working with formal/mechanical
			definitions and proofs, especially inductive definitions and recursive proofs. Or should
			I say recursive definitions and inductive proofs? Whatever, they're the same thing.
			Strings are a particularly simple and convenient playground for induction/recursion;
			which you will see many more of in an Algorithms course. When you read this section,
			don't just look at the content of the definitions and proofs; pay close attention to
			their structure and the process for creating them. </p>

			<statement>
				<p> A <term>string</term> (or <term>word</term>) over <m>\Sigma</m> is a finite
					sequence of zero or more symbols from <m>\Sigma</m>. Formally, a string <m>w</m>
					over <m>
						\Sigma</m> is defined recursively as either <ul>
						<li>
							<p> the empty string, denoted by the Greek letter <m>\epsilon</m>
					(epsilon), or </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> an ordered pair <m>(a, x)</m>, where <m>a</m> is a symbol in <m>

		<p> We normally write either <term>
				<m>a \cdot x</m>
			</term> or simply <term>
				<m>ax</m>
			</term> to denote the ordered pair <m>(a,x)</m>. Similarly, we
			normally write explicit strings as sequences of symbols instead of nested ordered pairs;
			for example, STRING is convenient shorthand for the formal expression <m>(S, (T, (R, (I,
			(N, (G,
				\epsilon))))))</m>. As a notational convention, we will use lower-case letters near
			the end of the English alphabet <m>(. . . , w, x, y, z)</m> for string variables, and
			UPPERCASE TEXT to typeset explicit (non-empty) strings.</p>

		<p>The set of all strings over <m>\Sigma</m> is denoted<term>
				<m>\Sigma^*</m>
			</term> (pronounced “sigma star”). It is very important
			to remember that every element of <m>\Sigma^*</m> is a <em> finite </em> string,

		<title>Two Recursive Functions</title>
		<p> Our first several proofs about strings will involve two natural functions, one giving
			the length of a string, the other gluing two strings together into a larger string.
			These two functions behave exactly the way you think they do, but if we actually want to <em>
			prove</em> anything about them, we first have to <em>define</em> them in a way that
			supports formal proofs. Because the objects on which these functions act (strings) are
			defined recursively, the functions must also be defined recursively. </p>

			<idx>
				<h>String Length</h>
			</idx>
			<statement>
				<p> The <term>length <m>|w|</m></term> of a string <m>w</m> is the number of symbols

			For example, the string FIFTEEN has length 7, the string SEVEN has length 5, and the

					order. For example, the string NOWHERE is the concatenation of the strings NOW
					and HERE; that is, NOW <m>\bullet</m> HERE = NOWHERE. (On the other hand, HERE <m>
					\bullet</m> NOW = HERENOW.) Formally, concatenation is defined recusively as

						w \bullet z =
						\begin{cases}
						z, &amp; \text{if}\ w = \epsilon \\
						a \cdot (x \bullet z) , &amp; \text{if}\ w = ax.

				<p>When we from describe the concatenation of more than two strings, we normally
					omit all dots and parentheses, writing <m>wxyz</m> instead of <m>(w \bullet (x

					fact (which we will prove shortly) that the function <m>\bullet</m> is
					associative. </p>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-Induction-on-Strings">
		<title>Induction on Strings</title>
		<p> Induction is <em>the</em> standard technique for proving statements about recursively
			defined objects. Hopefully you are already comfortable proving statements about natural
			numbers via induction, but induction is actually a far more general technique. Several
			different variants of induction can be used to prove statements about more general
			structures; here I describe the variant that I recommend (and actually use in practice).
			This variant follows two primary design considerations: <ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>The case structure of the proof should mirror the case structure of the
			recursive definition.</em> For example, if you are proving something about all <em>
			strings</em>, your proof should have two cases: Either (the base case or basis step)
			string <m>w = \epsilon</m>, or (the recursive case in the inductive step) string <m>w =
			ax</m> for some symbol <m>a</m> and string <m>x</m>. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>The inductive hypothesis should be as strong as possible.</em> The
			(strong) inductive hypothesis for statements about natural numbers is <em>always</em>
			"Assume the statement is true for all <m>j</m> such that <m>1 \leq j \leq k</m>." Then
			the inductive step is done on <m>k+1</m>. I recommend adopting a similar inductive
			hypothesis for strings: “Assume the statement is true for all strings <m>x</m>, such
			that <m>|x| \lt |w| </m>. Then for the case <m>w = ax</m>, we have <m>|x| = |w| - 1 \lt
			|w|</m> by definition of <m>|w|</m>, so the inductive hypothesis applies to <m>x</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, string-induction proofs have the following structure. </p>
		<example>


			<p>Suppose we want to prove that every string is <em>perfectly cromulent</em>, whatever
				that means. Proof details are not shown but depend on the precise definition of
				“perfectly cromulent”. </p>

			<p> Let <m>w</m> be an arbitrary string. </p>
			<p> There are two cases to consider. <ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<term>Basis Step:</term> The case where <m>w = \epsilon</m>. </p>
						<p> Show <m>\epsilon</m> is <em>perfectly cromulent</em>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<term>Inductive Step:</term> The case where <m>w = a x</m> for some
				symbol <m>a</m> and string <m>
								x</m>. <ol>
								<li>
									<p> Assume Inductive Hypothesis, for every string <m>x</m> such
				that <m>|x| \lt |w|,</m> that <m>x</m> is <em>perfectly cromulent</em>. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> Show <m>ax</m> is also <em>perfectly cromulent</em>,
				therefore <m>w</m> is <em>perfectly cromulent</em>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			Here are three canonical examples of this proof structure. When developing proofs in
			this
			style, I strongly recommend first mindlessly writing the text from the template in the
			example above with lots of
			space for each step, then filling in the actual theorem and the induction hypothesis,
			and only then starting to actually think.</p>

		<p> Many students are confused (or at least bored and distracted) by the fact that we are
			proving mind-bogglingly obvious facts. If you’re one of these students, try to remember
			that <em>the lemmas
				themselves are not the point</em>. Pay close attention to the <em>structure</em> of
			the proofs. Notice how each proof follows the template described above. Notice how every
			sentence of the proof follows <em>mechanically</em> from earlier sentences, definitions,
			and the rules of standard logic and arithmetic.</p>

			Finally, we'll conclude this section by formally defining several other common functions
			and terms
			related to strings.
		</p>
		<p> For any string <m>w</m> and any integer <m>1 \leq i \leq |w|</m>, the expression <m>w_i</m>
			denotes the <m>i</m>th symbol in <m>w</m>, counting from left to right (<em>note: this
			text uses indexing starting at 1, not 0 like most programming languages</em>). More
			formall, <m>w_i</m> is recursively defined as follows: <me>
				w_i =
				\begin{cases}
				a &amp; \text{if}\ w = ax \text{ and } i = 1 \\
				x_{i-1} &amp; \text{if}\ w = ax \text{ and } i \gt 1.
				\end{cases}
			</me>
			As one might reasonably expect, <m>w_i</m> is formally undefined if <m>i \lt 1</m> or <m>w
			= \epsilon</m>, and therefore (by induction) if <m>i \gt |w|</m>. The integer <m>i</m>
			is called the <term>index</term> of <m>w_i</m>. </p>

		<p> We sometimes write strings as a concatenation of their constituent symbols using this
			subscript notation: <m>w = w_1 w_2 \dots w_{|w|}</m>. While completely standard, this
			notation is slightly misleading, because it <em>incorrectly</em> suggestst that the
			entire string <m>w</m> contains at least three symbols, when in fact <m>w</m> could be a
			single symbol or the empty string. </p>
		<p> In actual code, subscripts are usually expressed using the bracket notation <m>w[i]</m>.
			Brackets were introduced as a typographical convention over a hundred years ago because
			subscripts and superscripts were difficult or impossible to type. We sometimes write
			strings as explicit arrays <m>w[1 .. n]</m>, with the understanding that <m>n = |w| </m>.
			Again, this notation is potentially misleading; always remember that <m>n</m> might be
			zero; the string/array might be empty. </p>
		<p> A <term>substring</term>of a string <m>w</m> is another string obtained from <m>w</m> by
			deleting zero or more symbols from the beginning and from the end. Formally, a string <m>
			y</m> is a substring of <m>w</m> if and only if there are strings <m>x</m> and <m>z</m>
			such that <m>w = xyz</m>. Extending the array notation for strings, we write <m>w [i ..
			j ]</m> to denote the substring of <m>w</m> starting at <m>w_i</m> and ending at <m>w_j</m> . More
			formally, we define <me>
				w[i..j] =
				\begin{cases}
				\epsilon &amp; \text{if}\ j \lt i, \\
				w_i \cdot w[i+1 .. j] &amp; \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}
