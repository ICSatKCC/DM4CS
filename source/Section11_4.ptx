    <introduction>
        <p>
            The <term>determinant</term> is a number (a scalar value) that is a certain function of the entries of a square matrix.
            The determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> is commonly denoted <m>\det (A)</m>, <m> \det A</m>, or <m>|A|</m>.
            Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and the area of the shape it represents geometrically.
            Historically, determinants were used long before matrices: A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations.
            The determinant "determines" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero).
        </p>

        <p>
            We will see in this section that the determinant is used to determine if a matrix has an inverse (the system of equations has a unique solution), to find an inverse matrix if it exists, and to solve systems of linear equations more quickly.
            The determinant has many other uses which would be covered in more advanced mathematics courses.

            Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
            The <term>determinant</term> of <m>A</m>, denoted as <m >\det (A)</m> is a number.
            If the matrix is a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix, this number is very easy to find.

                <p>
                    Suppose <m>A</m> is a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
                    The <m>ij^{th}</m> <term>cofactor</term> is defined to be <m>(-1)^{i+j} \times (ij^{th}</m> minor).

                </p>

                <p>
                    The cofactors of a matrix are so important that special notation is appropriate when referring to them.
                    The <m>ij^{th}</m> cofactor of a matrix <m>A</m> will be denoted by <term><m>\text{cof} (A)_{ij}</m></term> .
                    It is also convenient to refer to the cofactor of an entry of a matrix as follows.
                    For <m>a_{ij}</m> an entry of the matrix, its cofactor is just <m>\text{cof} (A)_{ij}</m> .
                    Thus the cofactor of the <m>ij^{th}</m> entry is just the <m>ij^{th}</m> cofactor.

                The (1,2) minor is the determinant of the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix which results when you delete the first row and the second column.
                This minor is therefore

                It follows

                    The determinant of a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m>, is obtained by picking a row (column) and taking the product of each entry in that row (column) with its cofactor and adding these up.
                    This process when applied to the <m>i^{th}</m> row (column) is known as <term>expanding the determinant along the <m>i^{th}</m> row (column)</term>.

                Here is how it is done by <em>expanding around the first column.</em>
                <me>
                    \overbrace{1(-1)^{1+1}\begin{vmatrix}3 &amp; 2\\ 2 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{11}} + \overbrace{4(-1)^{2+1}\begin{vmatrix}2 &amp; 3\\ 2 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{21}} + \overbrace{3(-1)^{3+1}\begin{vmatrix}3 &amp; 2\\ 3 &amp; 2 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{31}} = 0 .

            </p>

            <p>
                You see, we just followed the rule in the above definition.
                We took the 1 in the first column and multiplied it by its cofactor, the 4 in the first column and multiplied it by its cofactor, and the 3 in the first column and multiplied it by its cofactor.
                Then we added these numbers together.
            </p>

            <p>
                You could also expand the determinant along the second row as follows.
                <me>
                    \overbrace{4(-1)^{2+1}\begin{vmatrix}2 &amp; 3\\ 2 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{21}} + \overbrace{3(-1)^{2+2}\begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 3\\ 3 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{22}} + \overbrace{2(-1)^{2+3}\begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 2\\ 3 &amp; 2 \end{vmatrix}}^{\text{cof} (A)_{23}} = 0 .
                </me>
                Observe this gives the same number.
                You should try expanding along other rows and columns.
                If you don't make any mistakes, you will always get the same answer.

                    Now you know how to expand each of the <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices along a row or a column.
                    If you do so, you will get <m>-12</m> assuming you make no mistakes.
                    You could expand this matrix along any row or any column and assuming you make no mistakes, you will always get the same thing which is defined to be the determinant of the matrix <m>A</m>.
                    .

            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>
            Note that each of the four terms in the example solution above involves three terms consisting of determinants of <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices and each of these will need 2 terms.
            Therefore, there will be <m>4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24</m> terms to evaluate in order to find the determinant using the method of Laplace expansion.
            Suppose now you have a <m>10 \times 10</m> matrix and you follow the above pattern for evaluating determinants.
            By analogy to the above, there will be <m>10! = 3, 628 , 800</m> terms involved in the evaluation of such a determinant by Laplace expansion along a row or column.
            This is a lot of terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the difficulties just discussed, you should regard the above claim that you always get the same answer by picking any row or column with considerable skepticism.
            It is incredible and not at all obvious.
            However, it requires a little effort to establish it.
            This is done in the Elementary Linear Algebra book chapter 7 on the theory of the determinant.

                    Without using the corollary, you could expand along the first column.
                    This gives

                        1\begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 7\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 33.7\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{vmatrix} + 0(-1)^{2+1}\begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 77\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 33.7\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{vmatrix} +

                        0(-1)^{3+1}\begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 77\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 7\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{vmatrix} + 0(-1)^{4+1}\begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 77\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 7\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 33.77 \end{vmatrix} +
                    </me>
                    and the only non-zero term in the expansion is the first one

                    Now expand this along the first column to obtain

                    Next expand this last determinant along the first column to obtain the above equals

        <title>Finding Determinants Using Row Operations</title>

        <p>
            From the above section, <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> - <xref ref="thm-rows-cols-same-effect"/>, can be used to find determinants using row operations.
            As pointed out above, the method of Laplace expansion will not be practical for any matrix of large size.
            Here is an example in which all the row operations are used.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find the determinant of the matrix
                    <me>
                        A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\ 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3\\ 2 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 5 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Replace the second row by (-5) times the first row added to it.
                    Then replace the third row by (-4) times the first row added to it.
                    Finally, replace the fourth row by (-2) times the first row added to it.
                    This yields the matrix
                    <me>
                        B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\ 0 &amp; -9 &amp; -13 &amp; -17\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -8 &amp; -13\\ 0 &amp; -2 &amp; -10 &amp; -3 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    and from <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> it has the same determinant as <m>A</m>.
                    Now using other row operations,<m>\det (B) = \frac{-1}{3} \det (C)</m> where
                    <me>
                        C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 11 &amp; 22\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -8 &amp; -13\\ 0 &amp; 6 &amp; 30 &amp; 9 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    The second row of <m>B</m> was replaced by <m>(-3)</m> times the third row added to the second row.
                    By <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> this didn't change the value of the determinant.
                    Then the last row was multiplied by <m>(-3)</m> .
                    By <xref ref="thm-det-mult-mat-by-scalar"/> the resulting matrix has a determinant which is <m>(-3)</m> times the determinant of the un-multiplied matrix.
                    Therefore, we multiplied by <m>\frac{-1}{3}</m> to retain the correct value.
                    Now replace the last row with 2 times the third added to it.
                    This does not change the value of the determinant by <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/>.
                    Finally switch the third and second rows.
                    This causes the determinant to be multiplied by<m> (-1)</m> .
                    Thus <m> \det (C) = - \det (D)</m> where
                    <me>
                        D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -8 &amp; -13\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 11 &amp; 22\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 14 &amp; -17 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    You could do more row operations or you could note that this can be easily expanded along the first column followed by expanding the <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix which results along its first column.
                    Thus
                    <me>
                        \det (D) = 1(-3) \begin{vmatrix} 11 &amp; 22\\ 14 &amp; -17 \end{vmatrix} = 1485
                    </me>
                    and so <m>\det (C) = -1485</m> and <m>\det (A) = \det (B) = \frac{-1}{3}(-1485) = 495</m>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\ 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5\\ 3 &amp; -4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}

                    Replace the second row by <m>(-1)</m> times the first row added to it.
                    Next take <m>-2</m> times the first row and add to the third and finally take <m>-3</m> times the first row and add to the last row.
                    This yields
                    <me>
                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\ 0 &amp; -5 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -4 &amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; -10 &amp; -8 &amp; -4\end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    By <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> this matrix has the same determinant as the original matrix.
                    Remember you can work with the columns also.
                    Take <m>-5</m> times the last column and add to the second column.
                    This yields
                    <me>
                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -8 &amp; 3 &amp; 2\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ 0 &amp; -8 &amp; -4 &amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; 10 &amp; -8 &amp; -4\end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    By <xref ref="thm-rows-cols-same-effect"/> this matrix has the same determinant as the original matrix.
                    Now take <m>(-1)</m> times the third row and add to the top row.
                    This gives.
                    <me>
                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ 0 &amp; -8 &amp; -4 &amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; 10 &amp; -8 &amp; -4\end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    which by <xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> has the same determinant as the original matrix.
                    Let's expand it now along the first column.
                    This yields the following for the determinant of the original matrix.
                    <me>
                        \det \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1\\ -8 &amp; -4 &amp; 1\\ 10 &amp; -8 &amp; -4\end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    which equals
                    <me>
                        8 \det \begin{pmatrix}-1 &amp; -1\\ -8 &amp; -4\end{pmatrix} + 10 \det \begin{pmatrix}-1 &amp; -1\\ -4 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} = -82
                    </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We suggest you do not try to be fancy in using row operations.
                    That is, stick mostly to the one which replaces a row or column with a multiple of another row or column added to it.
                    Also note there is no way to check your answer other than working the problem more than one way.
                    To be sure you have gotten it right you must do this.

        <title>A Formula For The Inverse</title>

        <p>
            The definition of the determinant in terms of Laplace expansion along a row or column also provides a way to give a formula for the inverse of a matrix.
            Recall the definition of the inverse of a matrix in <xref ref="def-inverse-matrix"/>.
            Also recall the definition of the cofactor matrix given in <xref ref="def-cofactor-equals-minor"/>.
            This cofactor matrix was just the matrix which results from replacing the <m>ij^{th}</m> entry of the matrix with the <m>ij^{th}</m> cofactor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following theorem says that to find the inverse, take the transpose of the cofactor matrix and divide by the determinant.
            The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the <term>adjugate</term> or sometimes the <term>classical adjoint</term> of the matrix <m>A</m>.
            In other words, <m>A^{-1}</m> is equal to 1 divided by the determinant of <m>A</m> times the adjugate matrix of <m>A</m>.
            This is what the following theorem says with more precision.
        </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-inverse-from-cofactor">
            <title>Matrix Inverse is Adjugate Divided by Determinant</title>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    <m>A^{-1}</m> exists if and only if <m>\det (A) \neq 0</m>. If <m>\det (A) \neq 0</m>, then <m>A^{-1} = (a_{ij}^{-1}) </m> where
                    <me>
                        a_{ij}^{-1} = \frac{\text{adj} (A)_{ij}}{\det (A)} = \frac{\text{cof} (A)_{ji}}{\det (A)}
                    </me>
                    where <m>\text{cof} (A)_{ji}  = \text{cof} (A)_{ij}^T = \text{adj} A_{ij}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>


            <proof>
                <p>
                    From the definition of the determinant in terms of expansion along a column, and letting <m>(a_{ir}) = A</m>, if <m> \det (A) \neq 0</m>,
                    <me>
                        \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ir}\det (A)^{-1} = \det (A)\det (A)^{-1} = 1.
                    </me>
                    Now consider
                    <me>
                        \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ik}\det (A)^{-1}
                    </me>
                    when <m>k \neq r</m>.
                    Replace the <m>k^{th}</m> column with the <m>r^{th}</m> column to obtain a matrix <m>B_k</m> whose determinant equals zero by <xref ref="thm-switch-rows-neg-det"/>.
                    However, expanding this matrix <m>B_k</m> along the <m>k^{th}</m> column yields
                    <me>
                        0 = \det (B_k)\det (A)^{-1}  = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ik}\det (A)^{-1}.
                    </me>
                    Summarizing,
                    <me>
                        \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ik}\det (A)^{-1} = \delta_{rk} \equiv \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{if } r = k\\ 0 &amp; \text{if } r \neq k\end{cases}.
                    </me>
                    Now
                    <me>
                        \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ik} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ir} \text{cof} (A)_{ki}^T
                    </me>
                    which is the <m>kr^{th}</m> entry of <m>\text{cof} (A)^T A</m>.
                    Therefore,
                    <me>
                        \frac{\text{cof} (A)^T}{\det (A)} A = I.
                    </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the other formula in <xref ref="def-det-sum-of-cof"/> and similar reasoning,
                    <me>
                        \sum_{j=1}^n a_{rj} \text{cof} (A)_{kj} \det (A)^{-1} = \delta_{rk}.
                    </me>
                    Now,
                    <me>
                        \sum_{j=1}^n a_{rj} \text{cof} (A)_{kj} = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{rj} \text{cof} (A)_{jk}^T
                    </me>
                    which is the <m>rk^{th}</m> entry of <m>A\, \text{cof} (A)^T</m>.
                    Therefore,
                    <me>
                        A \frac{\text{cof} (A)^T}{\det (A)} A = I,
                    </me>
                    and it follows that <m>A^{-1} = (a_{ij}^{-1})</m>, where
                    <me>
                        a_{ij}^{-1} = \text{cof} (A)_{ij} \det (A)^{-1}.
                    </me>
                    In other words,
                    <me>
                        A^{-1} = \frac{\text{cof} (A)^T}{\det (A)}.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Now suppose <m>A^{-1}</m> exists.
                    Then by <xref ref="thm-prod-of-dets"/>
                    <me>
                        1 = \det (I) = \det (AA^{-1}) = \det (A)\det (A^{-1})
                    </me>
                    so <m>\det (A) \neq 0.

                <p>
                    First, find the determinant of this matrix.
                    Using row operations (<xref ref="thm-row-ops-dont-change-det"/> - <xref ref="thm-rows-cols-same-effect"/>), the determinant of this matrix equals the determinant of the matrix:
                    <me>
                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\ 0 &amp; -6 &amp; -8\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    which equals 12.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, find the cofactor matrix of <m>A</m>.
                    <me>
                        \text{cof}(A) = \begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 6\\ 4 &amp; -2 &amp; 0\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; -6 \end{pmatrix}
                    </me>
                    Each entry of <m>A</m> was replaced by its cofactor.
                    Therefore, from the above theorem, the inverse of <m>A</m> should equal
                    <me>
                        \frac{1}{12} \begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 6\\ 4 &amp; -2 &amp; 0\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; -6 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{6}\\ -\frac{1}{6} &amp; -\frac{1}{6} &amp; \frac{2}{3}\\ \frac{1}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.

                    First find its determinant.
                    This determinant is <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> .
                    The inverse is therefore equal to

                        6\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{6}\\ \frac{1}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; -\frac{1}{3}\\ -\frac{1}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} \end{pmatrix}^T =  \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}

                    and so we got it right.
                    If the result of multiplying these matrices had been something other than the identity matrix, you would know there was an error.
                    When this happens, you need to search for the mistake if you are interested in getting the right answer.
                    A common mistake is to forget to take the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

                    The cofactor matrix is

                    so the inverse is

        <p>
            This formula for the inverse also implies a famous procedure known as <term>Cramer's rule</term>.
            Cramer's rule gives a formula for the solutions, <m>\mathbf{x}</m>, to a system of equations, <m>A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}</m> in the special case that <m>A</m> is a square matrix.
            Note this rule does not apply if you have a system of equations in which there is a different number of equations than variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            In case you are solving a system of equations, <m>A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}</m> for <m>\mathbf{x}</m>, it follows that if <m>A^{-1}</m> exists,
            <me>
                \mathbf{x} = (A^{-1}A)\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}(A\mathbf{x}) = A^{-1}\mathbf{y}
            </me>
            thus solving the system.
            Now in the case <m>A^{-1}</m> exists, <xref ref="thm-inverse-from-cofactor"/> is a formula for <m>A^{-1}</m>.
            Using this formula,
            <me>
                x_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}^{-1} y_{j} = \sum_{j=1}^n\frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{cof} (A)_{ji}y_j.
            </me>
            By <xref ref="def-expanding-along-row"/>.
            the formula for the expansion of a determinant along a column,
            <me>
                x_i = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\det \begin{pmatrix}\cdot  &amp; \cdots &amp; y_1 &amp; \cdots \cdot \\ \vdots &amp;&amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots\\ \cdot  &amp; \cdots &amp; y_n &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdot   \end{pmatrix}
            </me>
            where here the <m>i^{th}</m> column of <m>A</m> is replaced by the column vector <m>(y_1, \cdots, y_n)^T</m>, and the determinant of this modified matrix is taken and divided by <m>\det(A).</m> This formula is known as Cramer's rule.

        </example>

        <p>
            For large systems Cramer's rule is less than useful because to use it you must evaluate determinants.
            However, you have no practical way to evaluate determinants for large matrices other than row operations and if you are using row operations, you might just as well use them to solve the system to begin with.
            It will be a lot less trouble.
            Nevertheless, there are situations in which Cramer's rule is useful.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Solve for <m>z</m> if

                        \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; e^t \cos t &amp; e^t \sin t\\ 0 &amp; -e^t\sin t &amp; e^t \cos t \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ t \\ t^2 \end{pmatrix}

                </p>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    You could do it by row operations but it might be easier in this case to use Cramer’s rule because the matrix of coefficients do not consist of numbers but of functions.
                    Thus
                    <me>
                        z = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; e^t \cos t &amp; t\\ 0 &amp; -e^t\sin t &amp; t^2\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; e^t \cos t &amp; e^t \sin t\\ 0 &amp; -e^t\sin t &amp; e^t \cos t\end{vmatrix}} = t((\cos t)t + \sin t)e^{-t}.

               This would normally take a lot of time because the matrix is a <m>4\times 4</m>, but row three
               only has one non-zero entry so we will expand along row 3. The only term is the one for column 4:
               <me>\begin{vmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
                2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
                0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\
                2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix} = 2(-1)^{3+4} \begin{vmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
                2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\
                2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\end{vmatrix}</me>.
                Now we must find the determinant of the <m>3\times 3</m> matrix (the <m>34^{th}</m> minor).

                Again, this isn't that terrible because the first row only has one non-zero entry. So choosing to expand
                around row 1, we have only a column 1 term.
                <me>2(-1)^{3+4} (1(-1)^{1+1}\begin{vmatrix}
                    1 &amp; 1\\
                    1 &amp; 3\end{vmatrix})
                </me>
                Now using the formula for the determinant of a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix we end up with
                <me>2(-1)^{3+4} (1(-1)^{1+1}((1\cdot 3) - (1\cdot1))) = -2 \cdot 2 = -4

                Here is one way to go about this:

                Subtracting row 1 from row 2 and then <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> row 1 from row 3.
                <me>
                    \begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -1\\
                      0 &amp; \frac{7}{2} &amp; -\frac{13}{2} \end{vmatrix}
                </me>
                Then subracting <m>\frac{7}{6}</m> row 2 from  row 3
                <me>
                    \begin{vmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -1\\
                     0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{32}{6} \end{vmatrix}
                </me>
                So our determinant is:
                <me>2\cdot 3\cdot -\frac{32}{6} = - 32</me>
