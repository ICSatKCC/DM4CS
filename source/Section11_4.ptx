    <title>Matrix Determinants</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>The determinant is a number (a scalar value) that is a certain function of the entries 
            of a square matrix. The determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> is commonly denoted <m>det(A)</m>,
             <m>det A</m>, or <m>|A|</m>. Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and 
             the area of the shape it represents geometrically. Historically, determinants were used long before matrices: 
             A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations. 
             The determinant "determines" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero).

            We will see in this chapter that the determinant is used to determine if a matrix has an inverse (the system of equations has a unique solution),
            to find an inverse matrix if it exists, and to solve systems of linear equations more quickly. The determinant has many other uses which would 
            be covered in more advanced mathematics courses. See also the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">Wikipedia article: Determinant.</url>
