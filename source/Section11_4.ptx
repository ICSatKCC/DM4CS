    <introduction>
        <p>The determinant is a number (a scalar value) that is a certain function of the entries 
            of a square matrix. The determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> is commonly denoted <m>det(A)</m>,
             <m>det A</m>, or <m>|A|</m>. Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and 
             the area of the shape it represents geometrically. Historically, determinants were used long before matrices: 
             A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations. 
             The determinant "determines" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero).
        </p>
        <p>
            We will see in this chapter that the determinant is used to determine if a matrix has an inverse (the system of equations has a unique solution),
            to find an inverse matrix if it exists, and to solve systems of linear equations more quickly. The determinant has many other uses which would 
            be covered in more advanced mathematics courses. See also the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">Wikipedia article: Determinant.</url>

            Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. The determinant of <m>A</m>, denoted as <m>det(A)</m> is a number. If the
matrix is a <m>2 \tiems 2</m> matrix, this number is very easy to find.

                    with two vertical lines. Thus

                    Suppose <m>A</m> is a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix. The <m>ij^{th}</m> <term>minor</term>, denoted as <m>minor(A)_{ij}</m> , 
                    is the determinant of the <m>2\times 2</m> matrix which results from deleting the <m>i^{th}</m> row and the <m>j^{th}</m>

           <p> Consider the matrix

                    The (1,2) minor is the determinant of the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix which results when you delete the first
                    row and the second column. This minor is therefore

                    row and the third column. This minor is therefore 
                    <me>det\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 &amp; 2\\

                    Suppose <m>A</m> is a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix. The <m>ij^{th}</m> <term>cofactor</term> is defined to be <m>(-1)^{i+j} \times
(ij^{th}</m> minor). In words, you multiply <m>(-1)^(i+j)</m> times the <m>ij^{th}</m> minor to get the <m>ij^{th}</m> cofactor.
The cofactors of a matrix are so important that special notation is appropriate when referring to them. The <m>ij^{th}</m> cofactor 
of a matrix <m>A</m> will be denoted by <m>cof(A)_{ij}</m> . It is also convenient to refer to the cofactor of an entry of a matrix as follows. For ai j an entry of
the matrix, its cofactor is just <m>cof(A)_{ij}</m> . Thus the cofactor of the <m>ij^{th}</m> entry is just the <m>ij^{th}</m>
cofactor.

        <example>
            <p> Consider the matrix

                     The (1,2) minor is the determinant of the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix which results when you delete the first
                     row and the second column. This minor is therefore 
                     <me>det\begin{pmatrix}
                         4 &amp; 2\\
                         3 &amp; 1\\
                         \end{pmatrix} = (4)(1) - (3)(2) = -2.</me>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     It follows
                     <me>cof(A)_{12} = (-1)^{1+2} det\begin{pmatrix}
                         4 &amp; 2\\
                         3 &amp; 1\\

                 </p>
                <p>
                    The (2,3) minor is the determinant of the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix which results when you delete the second
                    row and the third column. This minor is therefore 
                    <me>det\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 &amp; 2\\
                        3 &amp; 2\\
                        \end{pmatrix} = (1)(2) - (3)(2) = -4.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore,
                    <me>cof(A)_{23} = (-1)^{2+3} det\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 &amp; 2\\
                        3 &amp; 2\\
                        \end{pmatrix} = (-1)^{2+3} (-4) = 4.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly,
                    <me>cof(A)_{22} = (-1)^{2+2} det\begin{pmatrix}
                        1 &amp; 3\\
                        3 &amp; 1\\
                        \end{pmatrix} = -4.</me>
