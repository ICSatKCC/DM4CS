    <title>Program Correctness</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>The goal of this chapter is to introduce the process of verifying the correctness of
            computer algorithms and programs. Often this involves using induction, so the first
            section will review writing inductive proofs. The following sections will cover the
            basics of proving correctness.
