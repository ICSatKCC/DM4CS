		<example xml:id="ex-some-elementary-operations">

			<p> To illustrate the third of these operations on this particular system, consider the
				following. <me>x + y = 7</me>
                <me>2x - y = 8</me> The system has the same solution
				set as the system <me>x + y = 7</me>
                <me>-3y = -6.</me> To obtain the second system,
				take the second equation of the first system and add <m>-2</m> times the first
				equation to obtain <m>-3y = -6</m>. Now, this clearly shows that <m>y = 2</m> and so
				it follows from the other equation that <m>x + 2 = 7</m> and so <m>x = 5</m>. </p>
		</example>


		<p> Of course a linear system may involve many equations and many variables. The solution
			set is still the collection of solutions to the equations. In every case, the above
			operations of <xref ref="def-elementary-operations" /> do not change the set of
			solutions to the system of linear equations.</p>

		<theorem xml:id="thm-elementary-operations">
			<statement>
				<p> Suppose you have two equations, involving the variables, <me>(x_1 , · · · , x_n )</me>
                        <me>E_1
					= f_1 , E_2 = f_2</me> where <m>E_1</m> and <m>E_2</m> are expressions involving
					the variables and <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_2</m> are constants. (In the above example
					there are only two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and <m>E_1 = x + y</m> while <m>E_2
					= 2x - y</m>.) Then the system <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solution
					set as <me> E_1 = f_1, E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</me> Also the system <m>E_1 =
						f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solutions as the system, <m>E_2 = f_2 , E_1
					=
						f_1</m>. The system <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solution as
					the system <m>E_1 = f_1, aE_2 = a f_2</m> provided <m>a \neq 0</m>. </p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p> If <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n)</m> solves <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2 = f_2</m> then it solves
				the first equation in <m>E_1 =
						f_1, E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1 </m>. Also, it satisfies <m> aE_1 = a f_1</m>
				and so, since it also solves <m>E_2 = f_2</m> it must solve <m>E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a
				f_1 </m>. Therefore, if <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n )</m> solves <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2 = f_2</m>
				 it must also solve<m> E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</m>. On the other hand, if it solves
				the system <m>E_1 = f_1</m> and <m>E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</m> , then <m>aE_1 = a
				f_1</m> and so you can subtract these equal quantities from both sides of <m>E_2
				+aE_1 = f_2 +a f_1</m> to obtain <m>E_2 = f_2</m> showing that it satisfies <m>E_1 =
				f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> .</p>
				
				<p>The second assertion of the theorem which says that
				the system <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solution as the system, <m>E_2
						= f_2 , E_1 = f_1</m> is seen to be true because it involves nothing more
				than listing the two equations in a different order. They are the same equations.</p>

				<p>The third assertion of the theorem which says <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same
				solution as the system <m>E_1 = f_1, aE_2 = a f_2</m> provided <m>a\neq 0</m> is
				verified as follows: If <m>(x_1 , · · · , x_n )</m> is a solution of <m>E_1 = f_1 ,
				E_2 = f_2</m> , then it is a solution to <m>E_1 = f_1 , aE_2 = a f_2</m> because the
				second system only involves multiplying the equation, <m>E_2 = f_2</m> by <m>a</m>.
				If <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n)</m> is a solution of <m>E_1 = f_1 , aE_2 = a f_2</m>, then
				upon multiplying <m>aE_2 = a f_2</m> by the number <m>1/a</m>, you find that <m>E_2
						= f_2. \Box</m>
				</p>
			</proof>
		</theorem>

		<p>
			Stated simply, the above theorem shows that the elementary operations do not change
			the solution set of a system of equations.
		</p>
		<p> Here is an example in which there are three equations and three variables. You want to
			find values for <m>x, y, z</m> such that each of the given equations are satisfied when
			these values are plugged in to the equations. </p>
		<example xml:id="ex-elementary-operations">
			<statement>
				<p> Find the solutions to the system, <me>x + 3y + 6z = 25</me>
                <me>2x + 7y + 14z =
						58</me>
                <me>2y + 5z = 19.</me>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>To solve this system replace the second equation by <m>(-2)</m> times the first
					equation added to the second. This yields the system <md>
						<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
						<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
						<mrow> 2y + 5z \amp = 19 </mrow>
					</md> Now take <m>(-2)</m>
					times the second and add to the third. More precisely, replace the third
					equation with <m>(-2)</m> times the second added to the third. This yields the
					system <md>
						<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
						<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
						<mrow> z \amp = 3 </mrow>
					</md> At this point, you can
					tell what the solution is. This system has the same solution as the original
					system and in the above, <m>z = 3</m>. Then using this in the second equation,
					it follows <m>y + 6 = 8</m> and so <m>y = 2</m>. Now using this in the top
					equation yields <m>x + 6 + 18 = 25</m> and so <m>x = 1</m>. This process is
					called <term>back substitution</term>.</p>

				<p> Alternatively, you could have continued as follows. Add <m>(-2)</m> times the
					bottom equation to the middle and then add <m>(-6)</m> times the bottom to the
					top. This yields <me>x + 3y = 7, y = 2, z = 3</me> Now add <m>(-3)</m> times the
					second to the top. This yields <me>x = 1, y = 2, z = 3,</me> a system which
					has the same solution set as the original system. This avoided back substitution 
					and led to the same solution set. </p>
			</solution>

		<idx>Gauss Elimination</idx>
		<p>A less cumbersome way to represent a linear system is to write it as an <term>augmented
			matrix</term>. For example the linear system in <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations"/> can be written as <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				2 &amp; 7 &amp; 14 &amp; 58 \\
				0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 19 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</me>
			It has exactly the same information as the original system but here it is understood
			there is an <m>x</m> column <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				1 \\
				2 \\
				0 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>, a <m>
			y</m> column, <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				3 \\
				7 \\
				2 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>,
			and a <m>z</m> column, <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				6 \\
				14 \\
				5 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>.
			The rows correspond to the equations in the system. Thus the top row in the augmented
			matrix corresponds to the equation, <me>x + 3y + 6z = 25</me>. Now when you replace an
			equation with a multiple of another equation added to itself, you are just taking a row
			of this augmented matrix and replacing it with a multiple of another row added to it.
			Thus the first step in solving <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations" /> would be to take <m>
			(-2)</m> times the first row of the augmented matrix above and add it to the second row, <me>
			\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\
				0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 19 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</me>

			<!-- STOPPED HERE p60 "Note how this corresponds to 4.5" in book is next line -->
			Note how this corresponds to the first step in solving <xref
				ref="ex-elementary-operations" />. Next take (-2) times the second row and add to
			the third, <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\
				0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
				\end{array} \right).
</me>
			This augmented matrix corresponds to the system <md>
				<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
				<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
				<mrow> z \amp = 3 </mrow>
			</md> which is the same as the second step in
			solving <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations" />. By back substitution you obtain the
			solution <m>x = 1</m>, <m>y = 6</m>, and <m>z = 3</m>. </p>
			<p> In general a linear system is of the form
		<!--  <md>
				<mrow> a_{11}x_1 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n \amp = b_1 </mrow>
				<mrow> \vdots \dots \vdots \amp = \vdots </mrow>

				 &amp;\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
				a_{m1}x_1 + &amp;\dots &amp; + a_{mn}X_n &amp; = b_m \\
				\end{array}
</me>
			where the <m>
			x_i</m> are variables and the <m>a_{ij}</m> and <m>b_i</m> are constants. This system
			can be represented by the augmented matrix <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}

			Changes to a system of equations as a result of an elementary operation translate into
			changes of an augmented matrix resulting from a row operation. Note that <xref

			augmented matrix for a system of equations which has the same solution set as the
			original system. </p>

					The pivot column is the second. Hence the pivot position is the one in the first row and
second column. Switch the first two rows to obtain a nonzero entry in this pivot position.
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 1\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me> </p>
	<p>
	Step two is not necessary because all the entries below the first pivot position in the resulting
matrix are zero. Now ignore the top row and the columns to the left of this first pivot
position. Thus you apply the same operations to the smaller matrix

<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	1 \amp 2 \amp 2\\
    0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 2 \amp 1\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me> </p>
	<p>
	The next pivot column is the third corresponding to the first in this smaller matrix and the
second pivot position is therefore, the one which is in the second row and third column. </p>
<p> In this case it is not necessary to switch any rows to place a nonzero entry in this position
because there is already a nonzero entry there. Multiply the third row of the original matrix
by -2 and then add the second row to it. This yields
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 1\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					The next matrix the steps in the algorithm are applied to is
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{cc}
						-1 \amp -2\\
						0 \amp 0\\
						2 \amp 1\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					The first pivot column is the first column in this case and no switching of rows is necessary
because there is a nonzero entry in the first pivot position. Therefore, the algorithm yields
for the next step
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the algorithm will be applied to the matrix
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{c}
						0\\
						-3\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
						There is only one column and it is nonzero so this single column is the pivot column.
Therefore, the algorithm yields the following matrix for the echelon form.
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					To complete placing the matrix in reduced echelon form, multiply the third row by 3 and
add -2 times the fourth row to it. This yields
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 2\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Next multiply the second row by 3 and take 2 times the fourth row and add to it. Then add
the fourth row to the first.
<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 6 \amp 9 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Next work on the fourth column in the same way.
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{ccccc}
						0 \amp 3 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 6 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Take <m>-1/2</m> times the second row and add to the first.
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{ccccc}
						0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 6 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -3\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, divide by the value of the leading entries in the nonzero rows.
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{ccccc}
						0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0\\

			The above algorithm is the way a computer would obtain a reduced echelon form for
a given matrix. It is not necessary for you to pretend you are a computer but if you like
to do so, the algorithm described above will work. The main idea is to do row operations
in such a way as to end up with a matrix in echelon form or row reduced echelon form
because when this has been done, the resulting augmented matrix will allow you to describe
the solutions to the linear system of equations in a meaningful way. When you do row
operations until you obtain row reduced echelon form, the process is called the <term>Gauss
Jordan method</term><idx><h>Gauss Jordan Method</h></idx>. Otherwise, it is called <term>Gauss elimination</term>.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Give the complete solution to the system of equations, <m>5x+10y-7z = -2</m>,
<m>2x + 4y - 3z = -1</m>, and <m>3x + 6y + 5z = 9</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The augmented matrix for this system is
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{cccc}
						2 \amp 4 \amp -3 \amp -1\\
						5 \amp 10 \amp -7 \amp -2\\
						3 \amp 6 \amp 5 \amp 9\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Multiply the second row by 2, the first row by 5, and then take (-1) times the first row and
add to the second. Then multiply the first row by 1/5. This yields

<me>\left(
	\begin{array}{cccc}
	2 \amp 4 \amp -3 \amp -1\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1\\
	3 \amp 6 \amp 5 \amp 9\\
	\end{array}
	\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Switch the last two rows to get
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{cccc}
						2 \amp 4 \amp -3 \amp -1\\
						3 \amp 6 \amp 5 \amp 9\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					then take -3 times the top added to 2 times the middle to get
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{cccc}
						-6 \amp -12 \amp 9 \amp 3\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 19 \amp 21\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Multiply bottom by 19 and take the second row times -1 added to the bottom. This gives
					<me>\left(
						\begin{array}{cccc}
						-6 \amp -12 \amp 9 \amp 3\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 19 \amp 21\\
						0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -2\\
						\end{array}
						\right)</me> a row of zeros with -2 at the right end, representing the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = -2 which
						has no solution so there is no solution to this system of equations. When this happens, the
						system is called <term>inconsistent</term>. In this case it is very easy to describe the solution set. The
						system has no solution.

			Here is another example based on the use of row operations.
