						<li>
							<p>

		<example xml:id="ex-some-elementary-operations">

			<p> To illustrate the third of these operations on this particular system, consider the
				following. <me>x + y = 7</me>
                <me>2x - y = 8</me> The system has the same solution
				set as the system <me>x + y = 7</me>
                <me>-3y = -6.</me> To obtain the second system,
				take the second equation of the first system and add <m>-2</m> times the first
				equation to obtain <m>-3y = -6</m>. Now, this clearly shows that <m>y = 2</m> and so
				it follows from the other equation that <m>x + 2 = 7</m> and so <m>x = 5</m>. </p>
		</example>


		<p> Of course a linear system may involve many equations and many variables. The solution
			set is still the collection of solutions to the equations. In every case, the above
			operations of <xref ref="def-elementary-operations" /> do not change the set of
			solutions to the system of linear equations.</p>

		<theorem xml:id="thm-elementary-operations">
			<statement>
				<p> Suppose you have two equations, involving the variables, <me>(x_1 , · · · , x_n
						)</me>
                        <me>E_1
						= f_1 , E_2 = f_2</me> where <m>E_1</m> and <m>E_2</m> are expressions
					involving the variables and <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_2</m> are constants. (In the
					above example there are only two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and <m>E_1 = x
					+ y</m> while <m>E_2
						= 2x - y</m>.) Then the system <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2 = f_2</m> has the same
					solution set as <me> E_1 = f_1, E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</me> Also the system <m>E_1
					=
						f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solutions as the system, <m>E_2 = f_2 , E_1
					=
						f_1</m>. The system <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has the same solution as
					the system <m>E_1 = f_1, aE_2 = a f_2</m> provided <m>a \neq 0</m>. </p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p> If <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n)</m> solves <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2 = f_2</m> then it solves
					the first equation in <m>E_1 =
						f_1, E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1 </m>. Also, it satisfies <m> aE_1 = a f_1</m>
					and so, since it also solves <m>E_2 = f_2</m> it must solve <m>E_2 + aE_1 = f_2
						+ a
						f_1 </m>. Therefore, if <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n )</m> solves <m>E_1 = f_1, E_2
						= f_2</m> it must also solve<m> E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</m>. On the other
					hand, if it solves the system <m>E_1 = f_1</m> and <m>E_2 + aE_1 = f_2 + a f_1</m>
					, then <m>aE_1 = a
						f_1</m> and so you can subtract these equal quantities from both sides of <m>E_2
					+aE_1 = f_2 +a f_1</m> to obtain <m>E_2 = f_2</m> showing that it satisfies <m>E_1
					=
						f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> .</p>

				<p>The second assertion of the theorem which says that the system <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2
					= f_2</m> has the same solution as the system, <m>E_2
						= f_2 , E_1 = f_1</m> is seen to be true because it involves nothing more
					than listing the two equations in a different order. They are the same
					equations.</p>

				<p>The third assertion of the theorem which says <m>E_1 = f_1 , E_2 = f_2</m> has
					the same solution as the system <m>E_1 = f_1, aE_2 = a f_2</m> provided <m>a\neq
					0</m> is verified as follows: If <m>(x_1 , · · · , x_n )</m> is a solution of <m>E_1
					= f_1 ,
						E_2 = f_2</m> , then it is a solution to <m>E_1 = f_1 , aE_2 = a f_2</m>
					because the second system only involves multiplying the equation, <m>E_2 = f_2</m>
					by <m>a</m>. If <m>(x_1, · · · , x_n)</m> is a solution of <m>E_1 = f_1 , aE_2 =
					a f_2</m>, then upon multiplying <m>aE_2 = a f_2</m> by the number <m>1/a</m>,
					you find that <m>E_2
						= f_2. \Box</m>
				</p>
			</proof>
		</theorem>

		<p>
			Stated simply, the above theorem shows that the elementary operations do not change
			the solution set of a system of equations.
		</p>
		<p> Here is an example in which there are three equations and three variables. You want to
			find values for <m>x, y, z</m> such that each of the given equations are satisfied when
			these values are plugged in to the equations. </p>
		<example xml:id="ex-elementary-operations">
			<statement>
				<p> Find the solutions to the system, <me>x + 3y + 6z = 25</me>
                <me>2x + 7y + 14z =
						58</me>
                <me>2y + 5z = 19.</me>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>To solve this system replace the second equation by <m>(-2)</m> times the first
					equation added to the second. This yields the system <md>
						<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
						<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
						<mrow> 2y + 5z \amp = 19 </mrow>
					</md> Now take <m>(-2)</m>
					times the second and add to the third. More precisely, replace the third
					equation with <m>(-2)</m> times the second added to the third. This yields the
					system <md>
						<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
						<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
						<mrow> z \amp = 3 </mrow>
					</md> At this point, you can
					tell what the solution is. This system has the same solution as the original
					system and in the above, <m>z = 3</m>. Then using this in the second equation,
					it follows <m>y + 6 = 8</m> and so <m>y = 2</m>. Now using this in the top
					equation yields <m>x + 6 + 18 = 25</m> and so <m>x = 1</m>. This process is
					called <term>back substitution</term>.</p>

				<p> Alternatively, you could have continued as follows. Add <m>(-2)</m> times the
					bottom equation to the middle and then add <m>(-6)</m> times the bottom to the
					top. This yields <me>x + 3y = 7, y = 2, z = 3</me> Now add <m>(-3)</m> times the
					second to the top. This yields <me>x = 1, y = 2, z = 3,</me> a system which has
					the same solution set as the original system. This avoided back substitution and
					led to the same solution set. </p>
			</solution>

		<idx>Gauss Elimination</idx>
		<p>A less cumbersome way to represent a linear system is to write it as an <term>augmented
			matrix</term>. For example the linear system in <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations" />
			can be written as <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				2 &amp; 7 &amp; 14 &amp; 58 \\
				0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 19 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</me>
			It has exactly the same information as the original system but here it is understood
			there is an <m>x</m> column <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				1 \\
				2 \\
				0 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>, a <m>
			y</m> column, <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				3 \\
				7 \\
				2 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>,
			and a <m>z</m> column, <m>
				\left( \begin{array}{c}
				6 \\
				14 \\
				5 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</m>.
			The rows correspond to the equations in the system. Thus the top row in the augmented
			matrix corresponds to the equation, <me>x + 3y + 6z = 25</me>. Now when you replace an
			equation with a multiple of another equation added to itself, you are just taking a row
			of this augmented matrix and replacing it with a multiple of another row added to it.
			Thus the first step in solving <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations" /> would be to take <m>
			(-2)</m> times the first row of the augmented matrix above and add it to the second row, <me>
			\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\
				0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 19 \\
				\end{array} \right)
</me>

			<!-- STOPPED HERE p60 "Note how this corresponds to 4.5" in book is next line -->
			Note how this corresponds to the first step in solving <xref
				ref="ex-elementary-operations" />. Next take (-2) times the second row and add to
			the third, <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				1 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 25 \\
				0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \\
				0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
				\end{array} \right).
</me>
			This augmented matrix corresponds to the system <md>
				<mrow> x + 3y + 6z \amp = 25 </mrow>
				<mrow> y + 2z \amp = 8 </mrow>
				<mrow> z \amp = 3 </mrow>
			</md> which is the same as the second step in
			solving <xref ref="ex-elementary-operations" />. By back substitution you obtain the
			solution <m>x = 1</m>, <m>y = 6</m>, and <m>z = 3</m>. </p>
		<p> In general a linear system is of the form <!--  <md>
				<mrow> a_{11}x_1 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n \amp = b_1 </mrow>
				<mrow> \vdots \dots \vdots \amp = \vdots </mrow>
				<mrow> a_m1x_1 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n \amp = b_m </mrow>
			</md> -->
			<me>
				\begin{array}{c c c c c c}
				a_{11}x_1 + &amp;\dots &amp; + a_{1n}x_n &amp; = b_1 \\
				&amp;\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
				a_{m1}x_1 + &amp;\dots &amp; + a_{mn}X_n &amp; = b_m \\
				\end{array}
</me>
			where the <m>
				x_i</m> are variables and the <m>a_{ij}</m> and <m>b_i</m> are constants. This
			system can be represented by the augmented matrix <me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c | c}
				a_{11} &amp; \dots &amp; a_{1n} &amp; b_1 \\

			Changes to a system of equations as a result of an elementary operation translate into
			changes of an augmented matrix resulting from a row operation. Note that <xref
				ref="thm-elementary-operations" /> implies that the row operations deliver an
			augmented matrix for a system of equations which has the same solution set as the
			original system. </p>

		<p> The above algorithm is the way a computer would obtain a reduced echelon form for a
			given matrix. It is not necessary for you to pretend you are a computer but if you like
			to do so, the algorithm described above will work. The main idea is to do row operations
			in such a way as to end up with a matrix in echelon form or row reduced echelon form
			because when this has been done, the resulting augmented matrix will allow you to
			describe the solutions to the linear system of equations in a meaningful way. When you
			do row operations until you obtain row reduced echelon form, the process is called the <term>Gauss
			Jordan method</term><idx>
				<h>Gauss Jordan Method</h>

					In this case it is very easy to describe the solution set. The system has no

		<p> There is some terminology connected to this which is useful. Recall how each column
			corresponds to a variable in the original system of equations. The variables

			there was one free variable, <m>z</m>, and two basic variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
			In de- scribing the solution to the system of equations, the free variables are assigned
			a parameter. In <xref ref="ex-infinite-sols" /> this parameter was <m>t</m>. Sometimes
			there are many free variables and in these cases, you need to use many parameters. Here
			is another example. </p>

				<p> Most people find it less confusing in the case of an infinite solution set to

		</example>
		<p> The number of free variables is always equal to the number of <term>different</term>

				\right).</me> There are a lot of cases to consider but it is not necessary to make a
			major production of this. Do row operations till you obtain a matrix in echelon form or
			reduced echelon form and determine whether there is a solution. If there is, see if
			there are free variables. In this case, there will be infinitely many solutions. Find
			them by assigning different parameters to the free variables and obtain the solution. If
			there are no free variables, then there will be a unique solution which is easily
			determined once the augmented matrix is in echelon or row reduced echelon form. In every
			case, the process yields a straightforward way to describe the solutions to the linear
			system. As indicated above, you are probably less likely to become confused if you place
			the augmented matrix in row reduced echelon form rather than just echelon form. </p>
