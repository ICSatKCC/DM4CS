    <title>Trees</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In this chapter we will study the class of graphs called trees. Trees are frequently used
            in both mathematics and the sciences. Our solution of <xref ref="lunch-possibilies1"

            illustrate or prove other concepts, a poor understanding of trees can be a serious
            handicap. For this reason, our ultimate goals are to: (1) define the various common
            types of trees, (2) identify some basic properties of trees, and (3) discuss some of the
            common applications of trees. </p>
