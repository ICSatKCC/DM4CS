<introduction>
  <!-- TODO  add Turing -->
<p>In this chapter we will study <em>languages</em>,<em>formal language theory</em>, <em>grammars</em>, <em>Turing Machines</em>, and
  <em>computability</em>.
  Our intent is to examine the question of how, and which, languages
  can be mechanically generated and recognized; and, ultimately, to see
  what this tells us about what computers can and can't do.</p>
