	<idx>Probability</idx>
	<introduction><p>We all have some intuitive understanding of the notions of <q>chance</q>
and <q>probability</q>. When buying a lottery ticket, we know that there is
a chance of winning the jackpot, but we also know that this chance
is very small. Before leaving home in the morning, we check the weather
forecast and see that, with probability <m>80\%</m>, we get <m>3</m> inches
of rain in Honolulu. In this chapter, we will give a formal definition
of this notion of <q>probability</q>. </p></introduction>

<subsection  xml:id="subsec3_1_1-probability-spaces"><title>Probability Spaces</title>
    <introduction><p>In this section, we give a formal definition of the notion of
<q>probability</q> in terms of sets and functions.</p>
</introduction>

		<definition  xml:id="def-sample-space">
			<title>Sample Space</title>
			<idx>sample space</idx>
			<statement><p>A <em>sample space</em> <m>S</m> is a non-empty countable set.
Each element of <m>S</m> is called an <em>outcome</em> and each subset
of <m>S</m> is called an <em>
event</em>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>


<p>In daily life, we express probabilities in terms of percentages. For
example, the weather forecast may tell us that, with <m>80\%</m> probability,
we will be getting a snowstorm today. In probability theory,
probabilities are expressed in terms of numbers in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
A probability of <m>80\%</m> becomes a probability of <m>0.8</m>. </p>

		<definition  xml:id="def-probability-function">
			<title>Probability Function or Distribution</title>
			<idx>probability function</idx>
			<statement><p>Let <m>S</m> be a sample space. A <em>probability function</em> on <m>S</m> is a
          function <m>P : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> such that <ul>

    <li>for all <m>x \in S</m>, <m>0 \leq P(x) \leq 1</m>, and </li>
    <li> <m>\sum_{x \in S} P(x) = 1</m>. </li></ul></p>
			</statement>
		</definition>


<p>For any outcome <m>x</m> in the sample space <m>S</m>, we will refer to
<m>P(x)</m> as the probability that the outcome is equal to <m>x</m>. </p>

		<definition  xml:id="def-probability-space">
			<title>Probability Space</title>
			<idx>probability space</idx>
			<statement><p>A <em>probability space</em> is a pair <m>(S,P)</m>, where <m>S</m> is a sample
space and <m>P : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> is a probability function on <m>S</m>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<definition  xml:id="def-probability-event">
			<title>Probability of an Event</title>
			<idx>probability of an event</idx>
			<statement><p>A probability function <m>P : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> maps each element of
the sample space  <m>S</m> (i.e., each outcome) to a real number in the
interval <m>[0,1]</m>. It turns out to be useful to extend this function so
that it maps any event to a real number in <m>[0,1]</m>. If <m>A</m> is an event
(i.e., <m>A \subseteq S</m>), then we define
   <me>P(A) = \sum_{x \in A} P(x) .</me>
We will refer to <m>P(A)</m> as the probability that the event <m>A</m> occurs.
</p></statement>
		</definition>


<p>Note that since <m>S \subseteq S</m>, the entire sample space <m>S</m> is an
event and
<me>P(S) = \sum_{x \in S} P(x) = 1 ,</me>

where the last equality follows from the second condition in
<xref ref="def-probability-function"/>.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-flipping-a-coin"><title>Flipping a Coin</title><p>Assume we flip a coin. Since there are two possible outcomes (the coin
comes up either <em>heads</em> (<m>H</m>) or <em>tails</em> (<m>T</m>)), the sample
space is the set <m>S = \{H,T \}</m>. If the coin is <em>fair</em>, i.e., the
probabilities of <m>H</m> and <m>T</m> are equal, then the probability function
<m>P : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> is given by
 <me>\begin{array}{lcl}
   P(H) &amp;= &amp;1/2 , \\
   P(T) &amp;= &amp;1/2 .
\end{array} </me>

Observe that this function <m>P</m> satisfies the two conditions in
<xref ref="def-probability-function"/>. Since this sample space has two elements,
there are four events, one event for each subset. These events are
 <me>\emptyset , \{H\} , \{T\} , \{H,T\} , </me>

 and it follows from <xref ref="def-probability-event"/> that
<me> \begin{array}{ccccccc}
   P(\emptyset) &amp;= &amp;0 , &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;  \\
   P(\{H\}) &amp;= &amp;P(H) &amp;= &amp;1/2 , &amp;&amp;\\
   P(\{T\}) &amp;= &amp;P(T) &amp;= &amp;1/2 ,  &amp;&amp;\\
   P(\{H,T\}) &amp;= &amp;P(H) + P(T) &amp;= &amp;1/2 + 1/2 &amp;= &amp;1 .
   \end{array} </me>
</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-flipping-a-coin-twice"><title>Flipping a Coin Twice</title>

<p>If we flip a fair coin twice, then there are four possible outcomes,
and the sample space becomes <m>S = \{ HH , HT , TH , TT \}</m>. For
example, <m>HT</m> indicates that the first flip resulted in heads, whereas
the second flip resulted in tails. In this case, the probability
function <m>P : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> is given by
\[ P(HH) = P(HT) = P(TH) = P(TT) = 1/4 .
\]
Observe again that this function <m>P</m> satisfies the two conditions in
<xref ref="def-probability-function"/>. Since the sample space consists of <m>4</m> elements,
the number of events is equal to <m>2^4 = 16</m>. For example,
<m>A = \{ HT , TH \}</m> is an event and it follows from <xref ref="def-probability-event"/>
that
<me> P(A) = P(HT) + P(TH) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 .</me>

In words, when flipping a fair coin twice, the probability that we see
one heads and one tails (without specifying the order) is equal to <m>1/2</m>. </p>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-rolling-a-die-twice"><title>Rolling a Die Twice</title>
  <p>If we roll a fair die, then there are six possible
outcomes (<m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, <m>5</m>, and <m>6</m>), each one occurring with
probability <m>1/6</m>. If we roll this die twice, we obtain the sample space

<me> S = \{ (i,j) : 1 \leq i \leq 6 , 1 \leq j \leq 6 \} ,</me>

where <m>i</m> is the result of the first roll and <m>j</m> is the result of the
second roll. Note that <m>|S| = 6 \times 6 = 36</m>. Since the die is fair,
each outcome has the same probability. Therefore, in order to satisfy
the two conditions in <xref ref="def-probability-function"/>, we must have
<me>P(i,j) = 1/36</me>
for each outcome <m>(i,j)</m> in <m>S</m>.</p>

<p>If we are interested in the sum of the results of the two rolls,
then we define the event
 <me>A_k = \text{ ``the sum of the two rolls } = k \text{'',}</me>

which, using the notation of sets, is the same as
<me> A_k = \{ (i,j) \in S : i+j=k \} .</me>

Consider, for example, the case when <m>k=4</m>. There are three possible
outcomes of two rolls that result in a sum of <m>4</m>. These outcomes are
<m>(1,3)</m>, <m>(2,2)</m>, and <m>(3,1)</m>. Thus, the event <m>A_4</m> is equal to

       <me>A_4 = \{ (1,3) , (2,2) , (3,1) \} .</me>
</p>

<p>In the matrix below, the leftmost column indicates the result of the
first roll, the top row indicates the result of the second roll, and
each entry is the sum of the results of the two corresponding rolls.
<me>
\begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
 &amp;1 &amp;2 &amp;3 &amp;4 &amp;5 &amp;6 \\
\hline
\hline
1 &amp;2 &amp;3 &amp;4 &amp;5 &amp;6 &amp;7 \\
2 &amp;3 &amp;4 &amp;5 &amp;6 &amp;7 &amp;8 \\
3 &amp;4 &amp;5 &amp;6 &amp;7 &amp;8 &amp;9 \\
4 &amp;5 &amp;6 &amp;7 &amp;8 &amp;9 &amp;10 \\
5 &amp;6 &amp;7 &amp;8 &amp;9 &amp;10 &amp;11 \\
6 &amp;7 &amp;8 &amp;9 &amp;10 &amp;11 &amp;12  \\
\hline
\end{array}
</me></p>

<p>As can be seen from this matrix, the event <m>A_k</m> is non-empty only
if <m>k \in \{2,3,\ldots,12\}</m>. For any other <m>k</m>, the event <m>A_k</m> is
empty, which means that it can never occur.</p>

<p>It follows from <xref ref="def-probability-event"/> that
<me>P \left( A_k \right) = \sum_{(i,j) \in A_k} P(i,j)
            = \sum_{(i,j) \in A_k} 1/36
            = |A_k| / 36 .</me>
For example, the number <m>4</m> occurs three times in the matrix and,
therefore, the event <m>A_4</m> has size three. Observe that we have already
seen this above. It follows that
 <me>P \left( A_4 \right) = |A_4|/36 = 3/36 = 1/12 .</me>

In a similar way, we see that
<me> \begin{array}{cclcl}
   P\left( A_2 \right) &amp;= &amp;1/36, &amp;&amp; \\
   P\left( A_3 \right) &amp;= &amp;2/36 &amp;= &amp;1/18 , \\
   P\left(A_4\right) &amp;= &amp;3/36 &amp;= &amp;1/12 ,  \\
   P\left(A_5\right) &amp;= &amp;4/36 &amp;= &amp;1/9 , \\
   P\left(A_6\right) &amp;= &amp;5/36 , &amp;&amp; \\
   P\left(A_7\right) &amp;= &amp;6/36 &amp;= &amp;1/6 ,  \\
   P\left(A_8\right) &amp;= &amp;5/36 , &amp;&amp; \\
   P\left(A_9\right) &amp;= &amp;4/36 &amp;= &amp;1/9 , \\
   P\left(A_{10}\right) &amp;= &amp;3/36 &amp;= &amp;1/12 ,  \\
   P\left( A_{11}\right) &amp;= &amp;2/36 &amp;= &amp;1/18 , \\
   P\left(A_{12}\right) &amp;= &amp;1/36. &amp;&amp;
   \end{array}
   </me></p>

<p>A sample space is not necessarily uniquely defined. In the last example,
where we were interested in the sum of the results of two rolls of a
die, we could also have taken the sample space to be the set
<me> S' = \{ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \} .</me>
The probability function <m>{P}'</m> corresponding to this sample space
<m>S'</m> is given by
 <me>{P}'(k) = P\left(A_k\right) ,</me>

because <m>{P}'(k)</m> is the probability that we get the outcome <m>k</m> in
the sample space <m>S'</m>, which is the same as the probability that
event <m>A_k</m> occurs in the sample space <m>S</m>.
You should verify that this function <m>{P}'</m> satisfies the two
conditions in <xref ref="def-probability-function"/> and, thus, is a valid
probability function on <m>S'</m>.</p></example>

			<statement><p> Recall that an event is a subset of the sample space <m>S</m>. In particular,

<proof><p>By <xref ref="def-probability-event"/>, we have

<example xml:id="ex-probability-of-sum-of-dice"><title>Probability of an Even Outcome When Flipping a Die Twice </title>
<p>Assume we roll a fair die twice. What is the
probability that the sum of the two results is even?
If you look at the matrix in <xref ref="ex-rolling-a-die-twice"/>, then you
see that there are <m>18</m> entries out of <m>36</m> that are even.
Therefore, the probability of having an even sum is equal to
<m>18/36=1/2</m>. Below we will give a different way to determine this
probability.
</p>

<p>The sample space is the set
<me> S = \{ (i,j) : 1 \leq i \leq 6 , 1 \leq j \leq 6 \} ,</me>

where <m>i</m> is the result of the first roll and <m>j</m> is the result of the
second roll. Each element of <m>S</m> has the same probability <m>1/36</m> of
being an outcome of rolling the die twice.</p>

<p>The event we are interested in is
<me>A = \{ (i,j) \in S : i+j \text{ is even} \} .</me>

Observe that <m>i+j</m> is even if and only if both <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are even
or both <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are odd. Therefore, we split the event <m>A</m> into
two disjoint events
<me>A_1 = \{ (i,j) \in S : i,j \text{ are both even} \}</me>

and
<me>A_2 = \{ (i,j) \in S :  i,j \text{ are both odd} \} .</me></p>
<p>By <xref ref="thm-probability-of-sequence-of-disjoint"/>, we have

<me>P(A) = P\left(A_1\right) + P\left(A_2\right) .</me>

The set <m>A_1</m> has <m>3 \cdot 3 = 9</m> elements, because there are <m>3</m>
choices for <m>i</m> and <m>3</m> choices for <m>j</m>. Similarly, the set <m>A_2</m>
has <m>9</m> elements. It follows that
 <me>P(A) = P\left(A_1\right) + P\left(A_2\right) =
           9/36 + 9/36  = 1/2 .</me></p>

<m>\overline{A} = S - A</m>. Intuitively, the sum of <m>P(A)</m> and
<m>P \left( \overline{A} \right)</m> must be equal to one, because the
event <m>A</m> either occurs or does not occur. Observe that this is similar to the
<xref ref="set_complement"/>. </p>

For any event <m>A</m>,

<proof><p>
Since <m>A</m> and <m>\overline{A}</m> are disjoint and <m>S = A \cup \overline{A}</m>,
it follows from <xref ref="thm-probability-of-sequence-of-disjoint"/> that

</p></statement>
<proof><p>
This is similar to the Law of Inclusion-Exclusion <xref ref="inclusion-exclusion"/>.
Since <m>B - A</m> and <m>A \cap B</m> are disjoint and
<m>B = (B - A) \cup (A \cap B)</m>, it follows from
 <xref ref="thm-probability-of-sequence-of-disjoint"/> that
<me>P(B) = P(B - A) + P(A \cap B) .</me>

Next observe that <m>A</m> and <m>B - A</m> are disjoint. Since
<m>A \cup B = A \cup (B - A)</m>, we again apply  <xref ref="thm-probability-of-sequence-of-disjoint"/>
and obtain
<me>P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A) . </me>
By combining these two equations, we obtain

Since there are <m>\lfloor 1000/2 \rfloor = 500</m> even numbers in <m>S</m>,
we have

Since there are <m>\lfloor 1000/3 \rfloor = 333</m> elements in <m>S</m> that

</theorem>
<example xml:id="ex-probability-of-full_house"><title>Probability of a Full House</title>
<p>In a standard deck of <m>52</m> cards, each card has a <em>suit</em> and a
<em>rank</em>. There are four
suits (spades, hearts,
clubs, and diamonds), and
13 ranks (Ace, <m>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10</m>, Jack, Queen, and King).

A hand of five cards is called a <em>full house</em>, if three of the
cards are of the same rank and the other two cards are also of the
same (but necessarily different) rank. For example, the hand:

<blockquote><p>7 of spades , 7 of hearts , 7 of diamonds ,
   Q of spades , Q of clubs</p></blockquote>
 is a full house, because it consists of three sevens and two Queens. </p>

<p>Assume we get a uniformly random hand of five cards. What is the
probability that this hand is a full house? To answer this question,
first observe that a hand of five cards is a <em>subset</em> of the set
of all <m>52</m> cards. Thus, the sample space is the set <m>S</m> consisting
of all <m>5</m>-element subsets of the set of <m>52</m> cards and, therefore,
<me>|S| = {{52} \choose 5} = 2,598,960 .</me>

Each hand of five cards has a probability of <m>1/|S|</m> of being chosen. </p>

<p>Since we are interested in the probability of a random hand being a
full house, we define the event <m>A</m> to be the set of all elements
in <m>S</m> that are full houses. By <xref ref="thm-probability-of-uniform"/>, we have
<me>P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} . </me>

Thus, to determine <m>P(A)</m>, it remains to determine the size of the
set <m>A</m>, i.e., the total number of full houses. For this, we will use
the Rule of Products <xref ref="rule-of-products"/>:
<ul>
<li><p>The procedure is <q>choose a full house</q>.</p></li>
<li><p>First task: Choose the rank of the three cards in the full house.
      There are <m>13</m> ways to do this.</p> </li>
<li><p>Second task: Choose the suits of these three cards.
      There are <m>4 \choose 3</m> ways to do this.</p></li>
 <li><p>Third task: Choose the rank of the other two cards in the full
      house. There are <m>12</m> ways to do this.</p> </li>
	<li><p>Fourth task: Choose the suits of these two cards.
      There are <m>4 \choose 2</m> ways to do this. </p></li>

Thus, the number of full houses is equal to
<me>|A| = 13 \cdot {4 \choose 3} \cdot 12 \cdot {4 \choose 2}
        = 3,744 . </me>
</p>
<p>We conclude that the probability of getting a full house is equal to
<me>P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{3,744}{2,598,960} \approx 0.00144 .</me>

<example xml:id="ex-monty-hall"><title>The Monty Hall Problem</title>
<p>The Monty Hall Problem is a well-known puzzle in probability theory.
It is named after the host, Monty Hall, of the American television
game show <em>Let's Make a Deal</em>. The problem became famous in
1990, when (part of) a reader's letter was published in
Marilyn vos Savant's column <em>Ask Marilyn</em> in the magazine
<em>Parade</em>:
<blockquote><p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the
    choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others,
    goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's
    behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a
    goat. He then says to you, <q>Do you want to switch?</q>
    Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Note that the host can always open a door that has a goat behind it.
After the host has opened No.3, we know that the car is either behind
No.1 or No.2, and it seems that both these doors have the same
probability (i.e., <m>50\%</m>) of having the car behind them. We will prove
below, however, that this is not true: It is indeed to our advantage
to switch our choice. </p>

<p>We assume that the car is equally likely to be behind any of the three
doors. Moreover, the host knows what is behind each door.
<ul>
 <li>We initially choose one of the three doors uniformly at random;
      this door remains closed. </li>
 <li>The host opens one of the other two doors that has a goat behind
      it. </li>
 <li>Our final choice is to switch to the other door that is still
      closed.</li>
</ul>
Let <m>A</m> be the event that we win the car and let <m>B</m> be the event that
the initial door has a goat behind it. Then it is not difficult to see
that event <m>A</m> occurs if and only if event <m>B</m> occurs. Therefore, the
probability that we win the car is equal to
 <me>P(A) = P(B) = 2/3 .</me>

		<!-- Schmid book Ch5 ex 3 -->
<p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. We flip a fair coin <m>2n</m> times and
consider the possible outcomes, which are strings of length <m>2n</m>
with each character being <m>H</m> (= heads) or <m>T</m> (= tails).
Thus, we take the sample space <m>S</m> to be the set of all such strings.
Since our coin is fair, each string of <m>S</m> should have the same
probability. Thus, we define <m>P(s) = 1/|S|</m> for each string <m>s</m> in <m>S</m>.
In other words, we have a uniform probability space.</p>

<p>You are asked to determine the probability that in the sequence of
<m>2n</m> flips, the coin comes up heads exactly <m>n</m> times:
<ol marker="(a)">
 <li>What is the event <m>A</m> that describes this?</li>
