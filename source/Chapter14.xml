<introduction>
<p>In this chapter we will study the class of graphs called trees. Trees are frequently used in both mathematics and the sciences. Our solution of <xref ref="lunch-possibilies1" text="type-global"/> is one simple instance. Since they are often used to illustrate or prove other concepts, a poor understanding of trees can be a serious handicap. For this reason, our ultimate goals are to: (1) define the various common types of trees, (2) identify some basic properties of trees, and (3) discuss some of the common applications of trees.
