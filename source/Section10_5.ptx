<introduction>
<p>In <xref ref="s-basic-definitions"/>, we studied relations and one important operation on relations, namely composition. This operation enables us to generate new relations from previously known relations. In <xref ref="s-properties-of-relations"/>, we discussed some key properties of relations. We now wish to consider the situation of constructing a new relation <m>R^+</m> from an existing relation <m>R</m> where, first, <m>R^+</m> contains <m>R</m> and, second, <m>R^{+ }</m> satisfies the transitive property.</p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Transitive Closure</title>

<p>Consider a telephone network in which the main office <m>a</m> is connected to, and can communicate to, individuals <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.  Both <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> can communicate to another person, <m>d</m>; however, the main office cannot communicate with <m>d</m>. Assume communication is only one way, as indicated. This situation can be described by the relation <m>R = \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)\}</m>. We would like to change the system so that the main office <m>a</m> can communicate with person <m>d</m> and still maintain the previous system. We, of course, want the most economical system.</p>

<p>This can be rephrased as follows; Find the smallest relation <m>R^{+ }</m> which contains <m>R</m> as a subset and which is transitive; <m>R^+ =\{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d), (a, d)\}</m>.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-transitive-closure"><title>Transitive Closure</title><idx>Transitive Closure</idx><notation><usage><m>r^+</m></usage><description>The transitive closure of <m>R</m></description></notation><statement><p>Let <m>A</m> be a set and <m>R</m> be a relation on <m>A</m>. The transitive closure of <m>R</m>, denoted by <m>R^+</m>, is the smallest transitive relation that contains <m>R</m> as a subset.</p></statement></definition>

<p>Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m>, and let <m>\mathcal{S} = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\}</m> be a relation on <m>A</m>. This relation is called the successor relation on <m>A</m> since each element is related to its successor. How do we compute <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m>?  By inspection we note that <m>(1, 3)</m> must be in <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m> . Let's analyze why. This is so because <m>(1,2) \in \mathcal{S}</m> and <m>(2, 3) \in \mathcal{S}</m>, and the transitive property forces <m>(1,3)</m> to be in <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m>. </p>

<p>In general, it follows that if <m>(a, b) \in \mathcal{S}</m> and <m>(b, c) \in S,</m> then <m>(a, c) \in \mathcal{S}^+ </m>. This condition is exactly the membership requirement for the pair <m>(a, c)</m> to be in the composition <m>\mathcal{S}\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}^2</m>. So every element in <m>\mathcal{S}^2</m> must be an element in <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m> . So we now know that, <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m> contains at least <m>\mathcal{S} \cup  \mathcal{S}^2</m> . In particular, for this example, since <m>\mathcal{S} = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\}</m> and <m>\mathcal{S}^2 = \{(1, 3), (2, 4)\}</m>, we have

<me>\mathcal{S} \cup  \mathcal{S}^2 =\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)\}</me>
</p>

<p>Is the relation <m>\mathcal{S} \cup  \mathcal{S}^2</m> transitive? Again, by inspection, <m>(1, 4)</m> is not an element of <m>\mathcal{S} \cup  \mathcal{S}^2</m>, but  <m>(1,3) \in \mathcal{S}^2</m> and <m>(3, 4) \in \mathcal{S}</m>. Therefore, the composition <m>\mathcal{S}^2 \mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}^3</m> produces <m>(1, 4)</m>, and it must be an element of <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m> since <m>(1,3)</m> and <m>(3, 4)</m> are required to be in <m>\mathcal{S}^+</m>.  This shows that <m>\mathcal{S}^3 \subseteq  \mathcal{S}^+</m>. This process must be continued until the resulting relation is transitive. If <m>A</m> is finite, as is true in this example, the transitive closure will be obtained in a finite number of steps. For this example,

 <me>\mathcal{S}^+ =\mathcal{S}\cup \mathcal{S} ^2\cup  \mathcal{S} ^3=\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4),(1, 3),(2, 4),(1,4)\}</me>
 </p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-transitive-closure-formula"><title>Transitive Closure on a Finite Set</title><statement><p>If <m>R</m> is a relation on a set <m>A</m> and <m>\lvert A \rvert = n</m>, then the transitive closure of <m>R</m> is the union of the first <m>n</m> powers of
<m>R</m>.  That is,
<me>R^+ = R \cup  R^2 \cup  R ^3 \cup \cdots  \cup  R^n\text{.}</me></p></statement></theorem>



<p>Let's now consider the matrix analogue of the transitive closure.</p>

<p>Consider the relation
<me>R = \{(1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3),(3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1)\}</me>
on the set <m>A = \{1,2, 3, 4, 5\}</m>. The matrix of <m>R</m> is
 <me>M=\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)</me></p>

<p>Recall that <m>R^2, R^3, \ldots</m>  can be determined through computing the matrix powers <m>M^2, M^3, \ldots</m>.  For our example,</p>

<p>How do we relate <m>\underset{i=1}{\overset{5}{\cup }}R^i</m> to the powers of <m>M</m>?</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-matrix-transitive-closure"><title>Matrix of a Transitive Closure</title><statement><p>Let <m>R</m> be a relation on a finite set and let <m>M^+</m> be the matrix of <m>R^+</m>, the transitive closure of <m>R</m>.  Then <m>M^+ = M + M^2 + \cdots + M^n</m>, using Boolean arithmetic.</p></statement></theorem>



<p>Using this theorem, we find <m>M^+</m> is the <m>5\times 5</m> matrix consisting of all <m>1's</m>, thus, <m>R^+</m> is all of <m>A \times A</m>.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection><title>Algorithms for computing transitive closure</title>
<p>Let <m>R</m> be a relation on the set <m>\{1, 2, \dots , n\}</m> with relation matrix <m>M</m>. The matrix of the transitive closure <m>M^+</m>, can be computed by the equation <m>M^+ = M + M ^2 + \cdots  + M^n</m>. By using ordinary polynomial evaluation methods, you can compute <m>M^+</m> with <m>n -1</m> matrix multiplications:
<me>M^+ = M(I + M(I +( \cdots  M(I+ M) \cdots )))</me></p>

<p>For example, if <m>n = 3</m>, <m>M^+ = M(I + M(I + M))</m>.</p>

<p>We can make use of the fact that if <m>T</m> is a relation matrix, <m>T + T = T</m> due to the fact that <m>1 + 1 = 1</m> in Boolean arithmetic. Let <m>S_k = M + M^2 + \cdots  + M^k</m>. Then </p>

<p><me>
\begin{split}
M &amp;= S_1\\
S_1(I+S_1)&amp;=M(I+M)=M+M^2 = S_2 \\
S_2(I+S_2)&amp;=(M+M^2)(I+M+M^2) \\
			&amp;=(M+M^2)+(M^2+M^3)+(M^3+M^4) \\
			&amp;=M+M^2+M^3+M^4 = S_4
\end{split}
</me>.</p>
<p>Similarly,
<me>S_4(I+S_4)=S_8</me>
and by induction we can prove
<me>S_{2^k}(I+S_{2^k})=S_{2^{k+1}}</me>
</p>

<p>Notice how each matrix multiplication doubles the number of terms that have been added to the sum that you currently have computed. In algorithmic form, we can compute <m>M^+</m> as follows.</p>

<algorithm xml:id="alg-trans-closure"><title>Transitive Closure Algorithm</title><statement>
<p> Let <m>M</m> be a relation matrix and let <m>M^+</m> be its transitive closure matrix, which is to be computed as matrix <m>T</m></p>
<listing><caption/>
<program>
<input>
1.0. S = M
2.0  T= S*(I+S)
3.0 While T != S
		3.1 S = T
		3.2 T= S*(I+S) // using Boolean arithmetic
4.0 Return T
</input>
</program>
</listing>
</statement>
</algorithm>

<note>
<p><ul>
<li><p> Often the higher-powered terms in <m>S_n</m> do not contribute anything to <m>M^+</m>. When the condition <m>T = S</m> becomes true in Step 3, this is an indication that no higher-powered terms are needed.</p></li>
<li> To compute <m>M^+</m> using this algorithm, you need to perform no more than <m>\lceil \log_2 n \rceil</m> matrix multiplications, where
<m>\lceil x \rceil</m> is the least integer that is greater than or equal to <m>x</m>. For example, if <m>R</m> is a relation on 25 elements,
no more than <m>\lceil \log_2 25 \rceil = 5</m> matrix multiplications are needed.</li>
</ul></p>
</note>

<p>A second algorithm, Warshall's Algorithm, reduces computation time to the time that it takes to multiply two square matrices with the same order as the relation matrix in question.</p>
