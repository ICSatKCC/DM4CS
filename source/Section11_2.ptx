            In this section we will review and expand upon what we learned about matrices and matrix arithmetic in <xref ref="chapter_7"/>.

        <title>Addition and Scalar Multiplication of Matrices</title>
        <p>You have now solved systems of equations by writing them in terms of an augmented matrix
and then doing row operations on this augmented matrix. It turns out such rectangular
arrays of numbers are important from many other different points of view. Numbers are
also called <term>scalars</term>. In this book, numbers will generally be either real or complex numbers.
I will refer to the set of numbers as F sometimes when it is not important to worry about
whether the number is real or complex. Thus F can be either the real numbers R or the
complex numbers C. However, most of the algebraic considerations hold for more general
fields of scalars.</p>

<p>A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers. Several of them are referred to as <term>matrices</term>.
For example, here is a matrix.
