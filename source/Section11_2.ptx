			You have now solved systems of equations by writing them in terms of an augmented matrix
			and then doing row operations on this augmented matrix.
			It turns out such rectangular
			arrays of numbers are important from many other different points of view.
			Numbers are
			also called <term>scalars</term>.
			In this book, numbers will generally be either real or complex numbers.
			I will refer to the set of numbers as F sometimes when it is not important to worry about
			whether the number is real or complex.
			Thus F can be either the real numbers R or the
			complex numbers C.
			However, most of the algebraic considerations hold for more general
			fields of scalars.
		</p>

		<p>
			A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers.
			Several of them are referred to as <term>matrices</term>.
			For example, here is a matrix.
			<me>
				\left( \begin{array}{c c c c}
				1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
				5 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7 \\
				6 &amp; -9 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\
				\end{array} \right)
			</me>
			The size or dimension of a matrix is defined as <m>m \times n</m> where <m>m</m> is the number of rows and
			<m>n</m> is the number of columns.
			The above matrix is a <m>3 \times 4</m> matrix because there are three
			rows and four columns.
			The first row is <m>(1 2 3 4)</m> , the second row is <m>(5 2 8 7)</m> and so forth.
			The first column is <m>
			\left( \begin{array}{c}
			1 \\
			5 \\
			6 \\
			\end{array} \right)
			</m>.
			When specifying the size of a matrix, you always list the
			number of rows before the number of columns.
			Also, you can remember the columns are
			like columns in a Greek temple.
			They stand upright while the rows just lie there like rows
			made by a tractor in a plowed field.
			Elements of the matrix are identified according to
			position in the matrix.
			For example, 8 is in position 2, 3 because it is in the second row and
			the third column.
			You might remember that you always list the rows before the columns
			by using the phrase <em>Row</em>man <em>C</em>atholic.
			The symbol, <m>(a_{ij})</m> refers to a matrix.
			The entry in
			the <m>i^{th}</m> row and the <m>j^{th}</m> column of this matrix is denoted by <m>a_{ij}</m> .
			Using this notation on the
			above matrix, <m>a_{23} = 8, a_{32} = -9, a_{12} = 2,</m> etc.
		</p>
        <p>
            There are various operations which are done on matrices. Matrices can be added mul-
tiplied by a scalar, and multiplied by other matrices. To illustrate scalar multiplication,
consider the following example in which a matrix is being multiplied by the scalar 3.
<me>
    3 \left( \begin{array}{c c c c}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
    5 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7 \\
    6 &amp; -9 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\
    \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{c c c c}
    3 &amp; 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 12 \\
    15 &amp; 6 &amp; 24 &amp; 21 \\
    18 &amp; -27 &amp; 3 &amp; 6\\
    \end{array} \right)
</me>
The new matrix is obtained by multiplying every entry of the original matrix by the given
scalar. If <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix, <m>-A</m> is defined to equal <m>(-1) A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two matrices must be the same size to be added. The sum of two matrices is a matrix
which is obtained by adding the corresponding entries. Thus
<me>\left( \begin{array}{c c}
 1 &amp; 2 \\
 3 &amp; 4 \\
 5 &amp; 2\\
 \end{array} \right) + 
 \left(\begin{array}{c c}
 -1 &amp; 4 \\
 2 &amp; 8 \\
 6 &amp; -4\\
 \end{array} \right) = 
 \left(\begin{array}{c c }
 0 &amp; 6 \\
 5 &amp; 12 \\
 11 &amp; -2\\
 \end{array} \right)
</me>
Two matrices are equal exactly when they are the same size and the corresponding entries
are identical. Thus
<me>\left( \begin{array}{c c}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0\\
    \end{array} \right) \neq
    \left( \begin{array}{c c}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    \end{array} \right)</me>

because they are different sizes. As noted above, you write <m>(c_{ij})</m> for the matrix <m>C</m> whose
<m>ij^{th}</m> entry is <m>c_{ij}</m> . In doing arithmetic with matrices you must define what happens in terms
of the <m>c_{ij}</m>  sometimes called the <term>entries</term> of the matrix or the <term>components</term> of the matrix.

            The following properties of matrices can be easily verified. You should do so. These
properties are called the vector space axioms.
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Commutative Law Of Addition.
<me>A + B = B + A,</me>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Associative Law for Addition.
<me>(A + B) +C = A + (B +C) ,</me>
 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Existence of an Additive Identity
<me>A + 0 = A,</me>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Existence of an Additive Inverse
            <me>A + (-A) = 0.</me>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
        </p>
<p>
    Also for <m>\alpha, \beta</m> scalars, the following additional properties hold.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            Distributive law over Matrix Addition.
<me>\alpha (A + B) = \alpha A + \alpha B,</me>

 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Distributive law over Scalar Addition
<me>(\alpha + \beta ) A = \alpha A + \beta A,</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Associative law for Scalar Multiplication
                <me>\alpha (\beta A) = \alpha\beta (A) ,</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Rule for Multiplication by 1.
                <me>1A = A.</me>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    As an example, consider the Commutative Law of Addition. Let <m>A + B = C</m> and <m>B + A =
D</m>. Why is <m>D = C</m>?
 <me>
    C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij} = B_{ij} + A_{ij} = D_{ij} .
 </me>
 Therefore, <m>C = D</m> because the <m>ij^{th}</m> entries are the same. Note that the conclusion follows
from the commutative law of addition of numbers.

            This is where things get interesting. Matrices can be thought of as a rule for making new
vectors from old vectors.

            Although the following description of matrix multiplication may seem strange, it is in
fact the most important and useful of the matrix operations. To begin with consider the
case where a matrix is multiplied by a column vector. First consider a special case.

<me>\left( \begin{array}{c c c}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
    \end{array} \right)  
    \left(  \begin{array}{c}
     7 \\
     8 \\
     9\\
    \end{array} \right) = \mathord{?}
   </me> 
   By definition, this equals
   <me>
    7 \left( \begin{array}{c} 
    1\\
    4\\
    \end{array} \right) + 8 \left( \begin{array}{c} 
    2\\
    5\\
    \end{array} \right) + 9 \left( \begin{array}{c} 
    3\\
    6\\
    \end{array} \right) =
    \left( \begin{array}{c} 
    50\\
    122\\
    \end{array} \right).
   </me>
        </p>
        <p>
 In more general terms,
 <md>
    <mrow> \begin{pmatrix}
        a_{11} &amp; a_{12}  &amp; a_{13} \\
        a_{21}  &amp; a_{22}  &amp; a_{23}  \\
        \end{pmatrix}   
        \begin{pmatrix}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3 \\
        \end{pmatrix} \amp  =

        x_1 \begin{pmatrix}
        a_{11}\\
        a_{21}\\
        \end{pmatrix} 
        + x_2 \begin{pmatrix} 
        a_{12}\\
        a_{22} \\
        \end{pmatrix} 
        + x_3 \begin{pmatrix} 
        a_{13}\\
        a_{23}\\

        <mrow> \amp =
            \begin{pmatrix}
           a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3\\

           \end{pmatrix}. </mrow>

            Thus you take <m>x_1</m> times the first column, add to <m>x_2</m> times the second column, and finally <m>x_3</m>
            times the third column. The above sum is called a <term>linear combination</term> of the given column
            vectors. These will be discussed more later. In general, a linear combination of vectors is
            just a sum consisting of scalars times vectors. When you multiply a matrix on the left by a
            vector on the right, the numbers making up the vector are just the scalars to be used in the
            linear combination of the columns as illustrated above.
