	<subsection><title>Sequences and Ways They Are Defined</title>

		<definition xml:id="def-sequence"><title>Sequence</title><idx>Sequence</idx><statement><p>A sequence is a function from the natural numbers into some predetermined set. The image of any natural number <m>k</m> can be written  as <m>S(k)</m> or <m>S_k</m> and is called the <m>k^{th}</m>  <em>term</em>  of <m>S</m>. The variable
					<m>k</m> is called the  <em>index</em>  or  <em>argument</em>  of the sequence.
					</p></statement></definition>


		<p>For example, a sequence of integers would be a function <m>S:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}</m>.</p>

		<example xml:id="ex-three-sequences"><title>Three sequences defined in different ways</title>
			<p><ol label="(a)">
					<li><p> The sequence <m>A</m> defined by <m>A(k) = k^2 - k</m>,  <m>k \geq  0</m>, is a sequence of integers.</p></li>
					<li><p> The sequence <m>B</m> defined recursively by <m>B(0) = 2</m> and <m>B(k) = B(k - 1) + 3</m> for <m>k \geq  1</m> is a sequence of integers. The terms of <m>B</m> can be computed either by applying the recursion formula or by iteration. For example;
							<me>
								\begin{split}
								B(3)  &amp;= B(2) + 3\\
								&amp; =(B(1)+3)+3\\
								&amp; = ((B(0)+3)+3)+3\\
								&amp;=((2+3)+3)+3=11
								\end{split}
							</me>
							or
							<me>
								\begin{array}{c}
								B(1) = B(0) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\
								B(2) = B(1) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8\\
								B(3) = B(2) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
								\end{array}
							</me>
							</p></li>
					<li><p>Let <m>C_r</m> be the number of strings of 0's and 1's of length <m>r</m> having no consecutive zeros. These terms define a sequence <m>C</m> of integers.</p></li>
					</ol></p>
		</example>


		<p>Remarks:</p>
		<p><ol label="(1)">
				<li><p>A sequence is often called a  <em>discrete function</em>.</p></li>
				<li><p>Although it is important to keep in mind that a sequence is a function, another useful way of visualizing a sequence is as a list. For example,
						the sequence <m>A</m> in the previous example could be written as <m>(0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \dots )</m>. Finite sequences can appear much the same way when they are the input to or output from a computer. The index of a sequence can be thought of as a time variable. Imagine the terms of a sequence flashing on a screen every second. Then <m>s_k</m> would be what you see in the <m>k^{th}</m> second. It is convenient to use terminology like this in describing sequences.
						For example, the terms that precede the <m>k^{th}</m> term of <m>A</m> would be <m>A (0), A(1), . . . , A(k -1)</m>.  They might be called the earlier terms.</p></li>
				</ol></p>

	</subsection>
	<subsection><title>A Fundamental Problem</title>
		<p>Given the definition of any sequence, a fundamental problem that we will concern ourselves with is to devise a method for determining any specific term in a minimum amount of time. Generally, time can be equated with the number of operations needed. In counting operations, the application of a recursive formula would be considered an operation.</p>

		<p><ol label="(a)">
				<li><p> The terms of <m>A</m> in <xref ref="ex-three-sequences" text="type-global"/> are very easy to compute because of the closed form expression. No matter what term you decide to
						compute, only three operations need to be performed.</p></li>
				<li><p> How to compute the terms of <m>B</m> is not so clear. Suppose that you wanted to know <m>B(100)</m>. One approach would be to apply the definition
						recursively: <me>B(100) = B(99) + 3 = (B(98) + 3) + 3 =\cdots</me>
						The recursion equation for <m>B</m> would be applied 100 times and 100 additions would then follow. To compute <m>B(k)</m> by this
						method, <m>2k</m> operations are needed. An iterative computation of <m>B(k)</m> is an improvement:

						<m>B(1) =B(0) +3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\
						\\
						B(2) =B(1)+3= 5 + 3 = 8\\
						\\
						\text{etc}.</m>

						Only <m>k</m> additions are needed. This still isn't a good situation. As <m>k</m> gets large, we take more and more time to compute <m>B(k)</m>.  The formula <m>B(k)=B(k-1)+3</m> is called a recurrence relation on <m>B</m>. The process of finding a closed form expression for
						<m>B(k)</m>, one that requires no more than some fixed number of operations, is called solving the recurrence relation.
						</p></li>
				<li><p> The determination of <m>C_k</m> is a standard kind of problem in combinatorics. One solution is by way of a recurrence relation. In fact, many problems in combinatorics are most easily solved by first searching for a recurrence relation and then solving it. The following
						observation will suggest the recurrence relation that we need to determine <m>C_k</m>. If <m>k \geq  2</m>, then every string of 0's and 1's with length
						<m>k</m> and no two consecutive 0's is either <m>1s_{k-1}</m> or <m>01s_{k-2}</m>, where <m>s_{k-1}</m> and <m>s_{k-2}</m> are strings with no two consecutive
						0's of length <m>k - 1</m> and <m>k - 2</m> respectively. From this observation we can see that <m>C_k= C_{k-2}+C_{k-1}</m> for <m>k\geq 2</m>. The terms <m>C_0=
						1</m> and <m>C_1 = 2</m> are easy to determine by enumeration. Now, by iteration, any <m>C_k</m> can be easily determined. For example, <m>C_5 = 21</m> can be computed with five additions. A closed form expression for <m>C_k</m> would be an improvement. Note that the recurrence relation for <m>C_k</m> is identical to the one for <xref ref="ex-fibonacci-sequence" text="title"/>. Only the basis is different.</p>

			<answer><p>Imagine drawing line <m>k</m> in one of the infinite regions that it passes through. That infinite region is divided into two infinite regions by line <m>k</m>. As line <m>k</m> is drawn through every one of the <m>k-1</m> previous lines, you enter another region that line <m>k</m> divides.
