  <subsection>
    <title>The notion of a set</title>
    <p>The term set is intuitively understood by most people to mean a collection of objects that
      are called elements (of the set). This concept is the starting point on which we will build
      more complex ideas, much as in geometry where the concepts of point and line are left
      undefined. Because a set is such a simple notion, you may be surprised to learn that it is one
      of the most difficult concepts for mathematicians to define to their own liking. For example,
      the description above is not a proper definition because it requires the definition of a
      collection. (How would you define <q>collection</q>?) Even deeper problems arise when you
      consider the possibility that a set could contain itself. Although these problems are of real
      concern to some mathematicians, they will not be of any concern to us. Our first concern will
      be how to describe a set; that is, how do we most conveniently describe a set and the elements
      that are in it? If we are going to discuss a set for any length of time, we usually give it a
      name in the form of a capital letter (or occasionally some other symbol). In discussing set <m>
      A</m>, if <m> x</m> is an element of <m> A</m>, then we will write <m>x \in A</m>.<notation>
        <usage>x \in A</usage>
        <description><m>x</m> is an element of <m>A</m></description>
      </notation> On the other
      hand, if <m> x</m> is not an element of <m> A</m>, we write <m>x \notin A</m>.<notation>
        <usage>x \notin A</usage>
        <description><m>x</m> is not an element of <m>A</m></description>
      </notation> The most
      convenient way of describing the elements of a set will vary depending on the specific set. </p>
    <p><em> Enumeration.</em> When the elements of a set are enumerated (or listed) it is
      traditional to enclose them in braces. For example, the set of binary digits is <m>\{0, 1\}</m>
      and the set of decimal digits is <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}</m>. The choice of a name
      for these sets would be arbitrary; but it would be <q>logical</q> to call them <m> B</m> and <m>
      D</m>, respectively. The choice of a set name is much like the choice of an identifier name in
      programming. Some large sets can be enumerated without actually listing all the elements. For
      example, the letters of the alphabet and the integers from 1 to 100 could be described as <m>A
      = \{a, b, c,\ldots , x, y, z\}</m>, and <m>G = \{1, 2, \ldots , 99, 100\}</m>. The three
      consecutive <q>dots</q> are called an ellipsis. We use them when it is clear what elements are
      included but not listed. An ellipsis is used in two other situations. To enumerate the
      positive integers, we would write <m>\{1, 2, 3,\ldots \}</m>, indicating that the list goes on
      infinitely. If we want to list a more general set such as the integers between 1 and <m> n</m>,
      where <m> n</m> is some undetermined positive integer, we might write <m>\{1,\ldots ,n\}</m>. </p>
    <p><em> Standard Symbols</em>. Sets that are frequently encountered are usually given symbols
      that are reserved for them alone. For example, since we will be referring to the positive
      integers throughout this book, we will use the symbol <m>\mathbb{P}</m> instead of writing <m>\{1,
      2, 3, \ldots \}</m>. A few of the other sets of numbers that we will use frequently are:<ul>
        <li>
          <p><m>\mathbb{(N)}</m>: the natural numbers, <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}</m></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>\mathbb{(Z)}</m>: the integers, <m>\{\ldots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,\ldots \}</m></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><m>\mathbb{(Z)}^+</m> or <m>\mathbb{(P)}</m>: the positive integers, <m>\{1, 2,
      3,\ldots \}</m></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>\mathbb{(Q)}</m>: the rational numbers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>\mathbb{(R)}</m>: the real numbers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>\mathbb{(C)}</m>: the complex numbers</p>
        </li>
      </ul></p>

    <p><term>Set-Builder Notation</term><idx>Set-Builder Notation</idx>. Another way of describing
      sets is to use set-builder notation. For example, we could define the rational numbers as <me>\mathbb{Q}=\{a/b
      \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b\neq 0\}</me>. Note that in the set-builder description for the
      rational numbers:<ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>a/b</m> indicates that a typical element of the set is a <q>fraction.</q>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> The vertical line, <m>\mid</m>, is read <q>such that</q> or <q>where,</q> and is used
      interchangeably with a colon. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>a, b\in \mathbb{Z}</m> is an abbreviated way of saying <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are
      integers. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Commas in mathematics are read as <q>and.</q>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The important fact to keep in mind in set notation, or in any mathematical notation, is that
      it is meant to be a help, not a hindrance. We hope that notation will assist us in a more
      complete understanding of the collection of objects under consideration and will enable us to
      describe it in a concise manner. However, brevity of notation is not the aim of sets. If you
      prefer to write <m>a\in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>b\in \mathbb{Z}</m> instead of <m>a, b\in
      \mathbb{Z}</m>, you should do so. Also, there are frequently many different, and equally good,
      ways of describing sets. For example, <m>\{x\in
        \mathbb{R} \mid x^{2}-5x+6 =0\}</m> and <m>\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, x^{2}-5x+6=0\}</m>
      both describe the solution set <m>\{2, 3\}</m>. </p>
    <p>A proper definition of the real numbers is beyond the scope of this text. It is sufficient to
      think of the real numbers as the set of points on a number line. The complex numbers can be
      defined using set-builder notation as <m>\mathbb{C} = \{a + b i:a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}</m>,
      where <m>i^2 = -1</m>. </p>
    <p>In the following definition we will leave the word <q>finite</q> undefined. </p>
    <definition xml:id="finite-set">
      <title>Finite Set</title>
      <statement>
        <p>A set is a finite set if it has a finite number of elements. Any set that is not finite
          is an infinite set.</p>

    <definition xml:id="cardinality">
      <title>Cardinality</title>

        <usage>\lvert A \rvert </usage>
        <description> The number of elements in a finite set <m>A</m>. </description>
      </notation>
      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>A</m> be a finite set. The number of different elements in <m>A</m> is called its
          cardinality. The cardinality of a finite set <m>A</m> is denoted <m>\lvert A \rvert</m>.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>As we will see later, there are different infinite cardinalities. We can't make this
      distinction until Chapter 6, so we will restrict cardinality to finite sets for now.</p>

    <p>It is clear, we hope, from the definition of a subset, that given any set <m> A</m> we have <m>A\subseteq
      A</m> and <m>\emptyset \subseteq A</m>. If <m>A</m> is nonempty, then <m>A</m> is called an <term>improper

      The empty set is an improper subset of itself.</p>

      <statement>
        <p> One reason that we left the definition of a set vague is Russell's Paradox. Many
          mathematics and logic books contain an account of this paradox. Two references are <xref
            ref="biblio-stoll-1961" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="biblio-quine-1966"
            text="type-global" />. Find one such reference and read it. </p>
